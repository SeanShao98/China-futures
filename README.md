# China-futures
China futures policy analysis project

## intro

This study investigates the motivations behind China’s introduction of agricultural futures contracts and traces how policy objectives evolved from the 1990s to the 2010s. 

Drawing on official documents, think tank reports, and exchange publications, it identifies a four-stage progression from risk control to market institutionalization and modernization. Early policies framed futures as tools to stabilize farmers’ incomes through hedging, while later reforms emphasized efficiency, income growth, and agricultural modernization.

Analyses of the Development Research Center’s reports, **keyword patterns**, and inter-agency comparisons reveal a coordinated policy structure in which the State Council defined strategy, the Ministry of Agriculture implemented development goals, and the CSRC and exchanges ensured regulatory prudence and market innovation. 

The findings suggest that agricultural futures have become not only mechanisms for price stabilization but also key instruments for integrating financial and agricultural reforms in China’s broader modernization agenda.
