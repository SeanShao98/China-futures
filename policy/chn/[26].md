2Statement of the Leaders

In for Forging a Potent System of Agricultural Products Market

Having just waved off the eventful '02, we are bowing in the promising '03 with an upswing

of verve inspired by the 16th CCP National Congress. Now at the threshold of the New Year, I

beg to extend, on behalf of the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (ZCE), our most heartfelt

thanks to all its member units and those who have been over the years consistently solicitous

about and helpful to its growth.

Guided by China Securities Regulatory Committee and adhering to the strategy of

"optimizing the setup through standardization", ZCE scored in last year a remarkable and

balanced expansion as a result of the reactivated surge of wheat futures and our successful efforts

at actualizing new futures and organizational streamlining. Now the market of wheat futures has

grown functionally fully fledged with a full range of virtually completed processes of designing,

or devising, contractual formats and work procedures both for such newly initiated futures as

cotton, refined sugar, rapeseed, quality wheat and for their options. Consequently now either

already or being put into effect are new regulatory systems for futures transaction and new

measures to stimulate technical innovations. Therefore the groundwork, on which the Zhengzhou

Futures Market would vigorously thrive on the basis of standardization, has been efficiently laid.

We are, in 2003, which is expected to go down in the history of ZCE as a vitally important

year for its growth, to avail ourselves, in line with the spirit of the resolutions adopted at the

National Conference on Securities/Futures Supervision and Regulation, of the opportunity

bestowed on us by the ongoing historical developments and the opportunity that is now most

favorable for us to initiate the transaction of such futures as quality wheat, cotton, refined sugar,

rapeseed. And we are striving for converting the Zhengzhou Futures Market from a commercial

establishment operating exclusively on wheat futures into a market system handling serial wheat

futures, or, in other words, from a commercial establishment dealing in only one cereal species

into a market system transacting a variety of agricultural products futures, in order to bring a

modernized market system of agricultural products futures into its nascent existence. Powerful

measures will be taken not just for boosting publicity for the said nascent market system but also

for bringing its potential into full play; this is all for contributing to the sustained, wholesome

and rapid growth of our national economy. We will continue to uplift the image of the

Zhengzhou Futures Market as a commercial institution of faith and probity by carrying

persistently on our policy for ensuring standardized management, to further upgrade the services

it is incumbent upon ZCE to provide, to intensify its effort at calling forth technical innovations,

and to reduce its operational cost while enhancing its efficiency.

In 2003 we would without fail lend ourselves to the outflow of sagacity from the important

thought of "the 3 'represents'" and put dutifully into practice the spirit of the 16th CCP National

Congress, so that we can march abreast of our era, make new breakthroughs, and create at full

steam for the Zhengzhou Futures Market a brand-new climate conducive to its large-scale

expansion on the track of standardized management.
