# Address by the General Manager

In 2010, under the correct leadership of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), China’s futures market continued to maintain sound momentum. The fundamental legal and regulatory framework of the futures market was further improved, market scale steadily expanded, stock index futures were smoothly launched, risk prevention and resolution capabilities were significantly enhanced, and the market’s function in serving the national economy became increasingly evident. The market has now preliminarily established the foundation and conditions for achieving faster development and better service to the national economy at a higher level.

Over the past year, Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (ZCE) also achieved positive results in various aspects of its work. We strengthened the front-line market supervision system, prudently resolved potential risks, and upheld the bottom line of zero systemic risk; actively innovated in market cultivation methods, deepened research on the market’s functions, and continuously enhanced our capacity to serve the real economy; established and improved the information technology system management framework, strengthened operations and maintenance management, and significantly improved technical support capabilities; increased efforts to build a high-caliber talent team, strengthened internal management, and further consolidated the foundation for sustainable development.

The year 2011 marks the beginning of China’s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, and it will also be a critical year for the futures market to shift from quantitative expansion to qualitative improvement. In the new year, ZCE will, in line with the central government’s guidance on the steady development of the futures market and the deployment of the National Securities and Futures Regulatory Conference, adhere to the theme of scientific development and the objective of serving the real economy. We will further revise and improve trading rules to facilitate the use of the futures market by enterprises along the industrial chain; strengthen the summary of experiences in serving agriculture, rural areas, and farmers (“Sannong”), and improve mechanisms and models for agricultural futures to better serve “Sannong”; reinforce front-line market supervision to ensure the normal functioning of price discovery and risk management; enhance the cultivation of already listed contracts while promoting the research and listing of new products; and initiate the development of a new generation trading system, adhering to the strategy of prioritizing information technology system construction. At the same time, we will expand market outreach and public communication, deepen society’s understanding of the functions and roles of the futures market, and create a favorable external environment for market development. We will strive in the new year to achieve even more outstanding results in celebration of the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
