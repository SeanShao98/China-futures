**Improving the Product Series: Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange to Develop Agricultural Product Index Futures**

With the listing of rapeseed oil futures imminent, Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (ZCE) Deputy General Manager **Mei Hongbin** stated last Saturday that the launch of this product is not only of significant importance to enterprises along the upstream and downstream of the edible oil industry, but will also help the Exchange itself improve its product series and lay the foundation for the next step—research on agricultural product index futures.  

At the rapeseed oil futures promotion conference held in Shanghai, Mei said that as early as August 2001, ZCE had placed the development of rapeseed oil futures on its agenda. However, due to various reasons, cotton and sugar futures were listed earlier than rapeseed oil. *“At present, research on rapeseed oil futures has been fully completed, and we are only waiting for the official launch of trading.”* He emphasized that the listing of rapeseed oil futures will complete the Exchange’s grain, cotton, oilseed, and sugar futures series, and will provide the groundwork for the subsequent development of agricultural product index futures.  

Previously, ZCE had released the draft of the rapeseed oil futures contract as well as related trading and delivery rules for public consultation. This is the Exchange’s first futures contract for an oilseed product. According to reports, the contract is expected to be listed as early as this Friday (June 8), with the nearest contract among the listed ones set to expire in July 2007.
