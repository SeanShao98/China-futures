# Grain Prices Likely to Remain Elevated Over the Next Decade

In June 2010, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) released the *Agricultural Outlook 2010–2019*, stating that average global grain prices are expected to remain at relatively high levels over the next decade and that the global food security situation remains worrisome.

The report issued by the OECD and FAO notes that average global grain prices are projected to stay relatively high over the next ten years and that food security remains a concern.

According to the report’s projections, over the next decade the average prices of wheat and coarse grains will be **15% to 40% higher** than their average levels during 1997–2006 (inflation-adjusted, in real terms). The real prices of vegetable oils are expected to increase by **40%**. The average price increases for dairy products are projected to range between **16% and 45%**.

The report states that, compared with the past decade, the growth rate of global agricultural output will slow, but will still maintain a certain pace. Brazil will be among the fastest-growing producers, with output expected to increase by **more than 40%** between now and 2019. Output in China, India, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine is also expected to rise by **over 20%**.

The report further points out that, although global food production is sufficient to feed the world’s population, the recent price spikes and the economic crisis have further worsened hunger and food insecurity. About **one billion people** worldwide are undernourished. If food prices remain high, food security will be further undermined—especially for the poor, who spend the bulk of their income on food—imposing even greater hardship. However, the report adds that establishing a well-regulated and effective trading system would foster fair competition and ensure that food moves from surplus to deficit regions.

Analyzing the causes of **price volatility**, the report concludes that recent turmoil has disrupted agricultural markets, including fluctuations in grain output and stocks, swings in oil prices, and the global economic recession. While short-term price volatility is currently elevated, there is no conclusive evidence that the long-term price trends for major grains have fundamentally changed. The extent to which world price movements affect domestic markets varies markedly across countries. Price transmission depends on several factors, notably a country’s integration with world markets, its infrastructure, and—most importantly—its trade and agricultural policies.

Presenting the *Agricultural Outlook 2010–2019* in Rome, OECD Secretary-General **Angel Gurría** and FAO Director-General **Jacques Diouf** said that the agricultural sector had demonstrated resilience in the face of recent price shocks and the economic downturn. Overall, this year’s cautiously formulated outlook is the most positive in several years. Nonetheless, governments should take further measures to ensure that farmers have access to more effective risk-management tools—such as production contracts, insurance schemes, and the use of futures markets—to hedge against risks.
