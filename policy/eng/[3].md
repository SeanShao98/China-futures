— Delivered at the Fifth Session of the Seventh National People’s Congress on March 20, 1992  
Li Peng, Premier of the State Council

Fellow Deputies,

On behalf of the State Council, I now present the Report on the Work of the Government for your deliberation. I also invite the members of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference to offer comments.

### I. Review of Domestic Work in 1991

The year 1991 was one in which our country continued to forge ahead along the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Confronted with dramatic changes in the international situation and severe natural disasters at home, the people of all ethnic groups in our country rallied closely around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core, implemented the Party’s basic line for the primary stage of socialism advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping—taking economic development as the central task, upholding the Four Cardinal Principles, and persevering in reform and opening-up—and achieved remarkable accomplishments that attracted worldwide attention.

The national economy and social undertakings developed in an all-round way. In 1991, gross national product increased by 7 percent over the previous year. Grain output reached 435.24 million tons, and cotton output reached 5.663 million tons; the total agricultural output value rose by 3 percent year-on-year—an abundant harvest in a year of disastrous calamities. Industrial production grew rapidly, with total output value up 14.2 percent. Output of major industrial products continued to increase: raw coal reached 1.09 billion tons, crude oil 139 million tons, steel exceeded 70 million tons, cement and chemical fertilizer (converted to pure) reached 248 million tons and 19.88 million tons respectively, further strengthening the country’s economic power. Nationwide fixed-asset investment rose by 18.6 percent; 215 large and medium-sized capital construction and key technological transformation projects were completed and put into operation, including Phase II of the Baoshan Iron and Steel project (3 million tons each of annual pig iron and steelmaking capacity), the Yangzi and Qilu ethylene projects (300,000 tons each per year), Shanghai’s Nanpu Bridge, the Qinshan Nuclear Power Station, the Lubuge Hydropower Station in Yunnan, Xining Caojiabao Airport in Qinghai, and development of the Tarim Oilfield in Xinjiang. Newly added that year were 27.14 million tons of coal production capacity, 14.91 million tons of oil production capacity, and 11.84 million kilowatts of power-generation capacity. Investment tilted toward basic industries such as energy, transport, raw materials, and water conservancy; the structure continued to improve, enhancing the economy’s potential for future growth. Domestic markets were brisk, with vigorous buying and selling; total retail sales of consumer goods grew by 10 percent in real terms. According to customs statistics, total imports and exports increased by 17.5 percent, and foreign-exchange holdings of the state rose substantially. Overall prices remained basically stable, with a 2.9 percent rise in the annual retail price index. The living standards of urban and rural residents continued to improve, and savings kept growing. Science and technology, education, culture, public health, sports, national defense, and other undertakings all made new progress.

Reform and opening-up took new steps. In agriculture, the household contract responsibility system was further consolidated and improved, systems for agricultural socialized services and farm-product markets were developed, and a grain special reserve system was established. In industry, the enterprise contract responsibility system was further improved, and a series of reform measures were adopted to improve the external environment, transform internal mechanisms, and invigorate large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. In price reform, we adjusted the rationed, low-price grain and edible-oil prices for urban residents that had remained unchanged for 25 years, raised prices of some basic industrial products that had long been set too low, and unified or narrowed the gap between plan-inside and plan-outside prices for certain products—steps that played a positive role in rationalizing price relations. Reforms of the planning system, the financial system, and the circulation system made new progress, with greater use of various economic levers to regulate economic operations. Pilot reforms in housing and social security were expanded and accelerated. Opening-up to the outside world continued to broaden. We gradually implemented a new system under which foreign-trade enterprises operate independently and assume their own profits and losses. The special economic zones and other open areas recorded gratifying new achievements, and the opening and development of Shanghai’s Pudong New Area proceeded step by step. Both the use of foreign capital and the scale of direct foreign investment reached historic highs. More than 12,000 new foreign-funded enterprises were established during the year; agreed amounts of direct foreign investment reached US\$12 billion, with US\$4.37 billion actually utilized; and a large number of major external cooperation projects were signed.

The political situation of stability and unity was further consolidated. Compared with the turbulence in the international environment, our country enjoyed political stability, social stability, and public confidence. The conviction of the people of all ethnic groups in building socialism with Chinese characteristics grew stronger. The participation in state affairs and democratic supervision by the democratic parties and non-Party individuals increasingly became normalized and institutionalized. The cause of unity and progress among all ethnic groups entered a new phase. Comprehensive measures to improve public security achieved notable results. Campaigns to eliminate pornography were carried out; all kinds of criminal activities were combated; corruption was punished in accordance with the law; and a number of cases of violations of law and Party discipline were dealt with. Social ills were curbed to some extent, which promoted clean governance and the building of socialist spiritual civilization. In particular, when faced with severe natural disasters, the people and the armed forces throughout the country stood united, fought tenaciously, and provided help from all quarters wherever disaster struck, minimizing losses. This reflected the flesh-and-blood ties between the Party and government and the people, demonstrated the advantages of our socialist system, and displayed the strong cohesion of the Chinese nation. We express our sincere thanks to compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, overseas Chinese, and the international community for their donations to our disaster relief.

The year 1991 was the first year for implementing the Eighth Five-Year Plan and the Ten-Year Program, and also the third year of continuing the program of rectification. We not only largely fulfilled the main indicators for developing the national economy in the first year of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, but also, through the arduous efforts of all the country’s people over the past three years, brought inflation under control and improved economic order; maintained sustained economic growth and reaped bumper harvests in agriculture year after year; and ensured abundant market supplies and a stable and contented life for the people. These achievements were made despite the lifting only recently of economic sanctions imposed by some countries, and were hard-won. The current state of our economy indicates that the main tasks of rectification have been basically accomplished, and that this specific phase of economic development can end on schedule. The smooth progress in rectification over the past three years is inseparable from the substantial strengthening of our economic power since the start of reform and opening-up. Reform and opening-up ensured the successful completion of rectification tasks, and rectification has in turn created favorable conditions for taking bigger steps in reform and opening-up.

Overall, the current economic situation in our country continues to develop in a positive direction, but there remain certain issues that cannot be ignored in the course of progress: structural adjustment has proceeded slowly; the poor economic performance and serious losses of some enterprises have not been fundamentally reversed; redundant construction is rearing its head again; the fiscal deficit has increased; credit scale and money issuance are on the high side; potential inflationary pressures persist; and irrational distribution patterns have yet to be fundamentally improved. Some of these problems are legacies accumulated over many years; others have arisen in recent years. They comprehensively reflect many contradictions in real economic life. We must make sustained, long-term efforts to gradually resolve these issues by deepening reform, expanding opening-up, and accelerating economic development.

Looking back on the work of 1991 and the three years of rectification—indeed, in the context of thirteen years of reform and opening-up—all our achievements are fundamentally attributable to implementing the Party’s basic line of “one central task and two basic points.” This line accords with the will of the people and has taken deep root in their hearts; it must be adhered to for the long term—unchanged for a hundred years. Going forward, we must implement this line with even greater resolve, accuracy, and comprehensiveness, and grasp the following key points.

Hold firmly to economic development as the central task. The fundamental task of socialism is to liberate and develop the productive forces; all work must serve and be subordinate to this central task. In recent years, our economy has developed and the people’s living standards have risen—this is the fundamental reason why we have withstood severe domestic and international tests. For socialist China to stand tall in the East with even greater vigor, we must concentrate on running our own affairs well; the key is to develop the national economy better and faster. We should set ambitious goals, work in a down-to-earth manner, emphasize efficiency, and strive for sustained, stable, and coordinated development—raising our economy to a new level every few years. Only in this way can we fundamentally prevent “peaceful evolution” and consolidate and improve the socialist system.

Reform and opening-up are the only path to liberate and develop the social productive forces. Revolution emancipates productive forces; reform does so as well. We intend, under the socialist system, to liberate and develop productive forces through reform and opening-up. The fundamental reason our society and economy have undergone immense changes over the past decade and more lies in reform and opening-up. Achieving the second-step strategic goal and the entire process of modernization equally depend on deepening reform and expanding opening-up. The criterion for judging the success or failure of reform and opening-up is primarily whether they are conducive to developing the productive forces of socialist society, to enhancing the comprehensive national strength of a socialist country, and to improving the people’s living standards. In reform and opening-up, we must emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, explore boldly, and be ready and able to absorb and draw on all the achievements of human civilization—including advanced technologies and all modern management practices that reflect the laws of contemporary socialized production from countries around the world, including the developed countries of the West—to serve socialist modernization.

Upholding the Four Cardinal Principles is the fundamental guarantee for reform, opening-up, and economic development. Only socialism can save China; only socialism can develop China. We must uphold the Four Cardinal Principles, remain vigilant against the trend of bourgeois liberalization, and address it promptly at the earliest signs; we must never allow it to spread unchecked, as the consequences would be extremely serious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, we must rely on the people’s democratic dictatorship to defend the socialist system and promote economic development and social progress. Only then can we stand firm and remain invincible.

Maintaining social and political stability is a prerequisite for reform, opening-up, and economic development. Reform and economic development cannot proceed amid social turmoil. Order brings prosperity, chaos brings decline. Long-term social and political stability accords with the fundamental interests of the Chinese people and of the people of the world, and its fundamental purpose is to facilitate better reform and development. Only by continuously deepening reform, steadily developing the economy, and constantly improving the people’s living standards can we lay a solid foundation for enduring peace and stability and fully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system.

We must “grasp with both hands, and both hands must be strong.” We must, with one hand, advance reform and opening-up, and with the other, crack down on all manner of criminal activity; with one hand build material civilization, and with the other, spiritual civilization. In combating crime and eliminating social ills, we must never be soft-hearted; softness leads to heavy losses. Cadres at all levels must be diligent and honest in government, and firmly establish the principle of serving the people—this bears on the country’s future and destiny.

We must promptly summarize experience and foster a pragmatic work style. There is no ready-made experience for building socialism with Chinese characteristics; we can only advance through exploration. We should encourage bold experimentation, build capability through practice, and blaze new trails. At the same time, we must promptly summarize experience, persist in what is right, correct what is wrong, and swiftly identify and resolve new problems that arise in practice. In both work and study, we must value practical results, creatively open new horizons, resolutely avoid formalism, and overcome bureaucratism. In this way, we can avoid or reduce mistakes and more smoothly achieve our goals in construction and reform.

### II. Seizing Favorable Opportunities to Accelerate Economic Development

Domestic conditions are in place, the international environment is favorable, and our socialist system has the advantage of concentrating resources on major undertakings. Over the long course of modernization, it is both necessary and feasible to create phases where development is relatively fast and efficient. Opportunity knocks but once; time waits for no one. We must seize the moment, concentrate our strength, and further accelerate the development of the national economy. The key tasks of economic work in 1992 are structural adjustment and efficiency improvement, with particular emphasis on achieving greater results in agriculture and in large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.

For this year’s plan, on the basis of keeping total social supply and demand basically in balance, GNP is targeted to grow by 6 percent; total fixed-asset investment by 8 percent. Investment must conform to industrial policies, avoiding blind expansion and redundant construction. Total retail sales of consumer goods are to grow by 12.3 percent; money issuance and the scale of new credit are to remain roughly at last year’s levels; and the retail price increase is to be kept within 6 percent. Considering that rectification has only just concluded and that certain instabilities remain in economic development, and given that the current focus is structural adjustment and efficiency improvement, the planned growth rate for this year leaves room for maneuver. We must do solid work and strive for even better actual outcomes. Regions with favorable conditions should move faster where possible. If all aspects of work are done better this year, the accelerated development of the economy in the latter three years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan will rest on a firmer foundation.

We will continue to devote major efforts to agriculture and strive for faster development of the rural economy. Rural work this year must fully implement the decisions of the Eighth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee: continue to stabilize the household contract responsibility system as the main form, steadily improve the dual-tier management system combining unified and separate operations, actively develop agricultural socialized services, and gradually strengthen the collective economy. We must take firm, effective measures to implement the strategy of revitalizing agriculture through science, technology, and education. We will systematically upgrade medium- and low-yield fields; while maintaining stable growth in total agricultural output, we will gradually adjust the agricultural production structure and vigorously develop high-yield, high-quality, and high-efficiency agriculture. We will effectively control the prices of agricultural inputs, resolutely stop arbitrary levies and fees, and genuinely lighten the burdens on farmers. We will continue to mobilize all parties to do a good job in poverty alleviation.

Deepening reform of farm-product pricing and circulation systems is key to further developing the rural commodity economy. We will actively promote reform of grain purchase and sale pricing; further establish and improve reserve and regulation systems for major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and edible oils; and develop wholesale and futures markets. We will diversify circulation channels: while giving play to the principal role of state-run and cooperative commerce, we will support farmers’ participation in commodity circulation and actively develop the tertiary industry.

Township and village enterprises play an extremely important role in the rural economy and have become an integral part of the national economy. In line with state industrial policies, market demand, and resource conditions, they should be encouraged to continue developing. The central and local governments must energetically assist the central and western regions, economically underdeveloped areas, and poor regions in developing township and village enterprises to change backward conditions quickly and improve farmers’ livelihoods.

In the aftermath of major disasters, we must attach greater importance to water conservancy. Current priorities are to accelerate comprehensive harnessing of the Huai River and Tai Lake. All regions should strengthen the management of medium and small rivers and carry out basic farmland water conservancy construction. Since last winter and this spring, drought has been severe in some areas; we must strengthen drought relief while also preparing for floods. Water conservation in urban and rural areas must be enhanced to ease the contradiction of tight water resources. We will reform land-use systems, use land rationally, protect arable land effectively, and develop, in a phased manner, cultivable wasteland, grasslands suitable for animal husbandry, and tidal flats. We will further strengthen soil and water conservation a
