# Opinions on Implementing the *Opinions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Further Strengthening Rural Work and Enhancing the Comprehensive Agricultural Production Capacity*

To the Departments (Bureaus/Commissions/Offices) of Agriculture, Agricultural Machinery, Animal Husbandry, State Farms (Reclamation), Township Enterprises, and Fisheries of all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and cities specifically designated in the state plan; the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps; all departments and bureaus of the Ministry and relevant directly affiliated institutions:

Since last year, agricultural departments at all levels—focusing closely on the twin goals of increasing grain output and farmers’ incomes—have conscientiously implemented the *Opinions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Certain Policies for Increasing Farmers’ Incomes* (Zhongfa [2004] No. 1) and the spirit of the Central Rural Work Conference, and have devoted themselves fully to all tasks. Grain production has seen a major turnaround; farmers’ incomes have grown rapidly; significant victories have been won in the prevention and control of animal diseases; and agriculture and the rural economy have developed comprehensively, thereby making a positive contribution to national macro-control and overall stability. Nevertheless, we must clearly recognize that agriculture remains the weak link in the national economy. The foundations for steady increases in grain output and sustained growth in farmers’ incomes are not yet solid; and the comprehensive agricultural production capacity urgently needs to be strengthened and enhanced.

In response, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council have attached great importance and issued the *Opinions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Further Strengthening Rural Work and Enhancing the Comprehensive Agricultural Production Capacity* (Zhongfa [2005] No. 1), which clarifies this year’s overall requirements for agricultural and rural work, sets the goals and tasks for strengthening comprehensive agricultural production capacity, and promulgates a series of forceful and highly operable policy measures. In accordance with this year’s No. 1 Central Document, agricultural departments at all levels must thoroughly implement the spirit of the 16th CPC National Congress and the Third and Fourth Plenary Sessions of the 16th CPC Central Committee, as well as the Central Economic Work Conference and the Central Rural Work Conference; fully implement the Scientific Outlook on Development; uphold the strategy of integrating urban and rural development and the policy of “giving more, taking less, and loosening restrictions”; conscientiously implement all policies; vigorously promote agricultural structural adjustment; accelerate the transformation of the mode of agricultural growth; strengthen comprehensive agricultural production capacity; strive to achieve stable increases in grain output and sustained growth in farmers’ incomes; and open up a new situation in agricultural and rural economic work.
