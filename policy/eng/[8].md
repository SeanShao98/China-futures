**State Council Opinions on Advancing Reform, Opening-Up, and the Stable Development of the Capital Market**  
Guo Fa [2004] No. 3

To the people’s governments of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government; and to all ministries and commissions of the State Council, and all agencies directly under the State Council:

Since the issuance of the *Notice of the State Council on Further Strengthening the Macroscopic Administration of the Securities Market* (Guo Fa [1992] No. 68), China’s capital market has developed rapidly and achieved remarkable results, becoming an important component of the socialist market economy. It has contributed significantly to reform and development of state-owned enterprises and the financial market, to optimizing resource allocation, and to promoting economic restructuring and growth. To implement the spirit of the 16th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenum of the 16th CPC Central Committee, and around the strategic goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, we hereby put forward the following opinions on proactively advancing reform, opening-up, and the stable development of the capital market.

## I. Fully recognize the importance of vigorously developing the capital market

Vigorously developing the capital market is an important strategic task and bears on the goal of doubling GDP in the first 20 years of this century.  
(1) It helps improve the socialist market economy, allowing the capital market to better optimize resource allocation and effectively transform societal funds into long-term investment.  
(2) It benefits structural adjustment and strategic reorganization of the state-owned economy and accelerates the development of the non-state economy.  
(3) It raises the share of direct financing, improves the structure and efficiency of the financial market, and safeguards financial security.

China’s capital market has developed in step with economic reform. Due to uncoordinated reforms and limits in early institutional design, deep-seated problems and structural contradictions remain, constraining market functions. These are issues encountered in development and must likewise be resolved through development. The 16th Party Congress set the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects; the Third Plenum adopted the *Decision on Some Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Socialist Market Economy*, which deployed capital-market development and pointed the way forward. We must recognize the situation, seize opportunities, shift mindsets, vigorously develop the capital market, raise the share of direct financing, foster a sound investment environment, and give full play to the capital market in capital formation, resource allocation, economic restructuring, and corporate governance—thus contributing to sustained, rapid, coordinated, and sound economic development and to building a moderately prosperous society in all respects.

## II. Guiding principles and tasks for advancing reform, opening-up, and stable development

Guiding principles: guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory and the Important Thought of the “Three Represents,” fully implement the spirit of the 16th Party Congress and the Third Plenum; uphold the principles of openness, fairness, and impartiality and the policy of rule of law, supervision, self-discipline, and standardization; serve the overall national economy and achieve coordinated development with it; govern the market according to law and protect investors—especially public investors; keep to a market-oriented reform approach, giving full play to market mechanisms; align reform intensity and development speed with market tolerance, balancing reform, development, and stability; solve problems encountered along the way through development while guarding against risk; and advance opening-up in a steady, step-by-step manner.

Tasks: with expanding direct financing and improving the modern market system so the market plays a more fundamental role in resource allocation as the goals, build a transparent, efficient, well-structured, well-functioning, and safe capital market. To this end, establish a market system conducive to fundraising by diverse enterprises and to meeting varied investor needs efficiently; improve a market-led mechanism for product innovation and form a product structure in which price discovery and risk management advance together and equity and debt financing are coordinated; cultivate listed companies and intermediaries that are honest, compliant, well-governed, and disciplined by market forces with survival-of-the-fittest mechanisms; and improve a supervisory system with clear mandates, effective risk control, and good coordination so as to protect investors’ lawful rights and interests.

## III. Further improve supporting policies to promote stable development

A stable capital market requires policy guidance and support. All departments shall refine relevant policies to create a favorable environment.

— **Improve the offering and listing approval system.** Establish mechanisms that allow quality enterprises of all types to access the market on an equal basis and raise allocation efficiency.  
— **Emphasize investment returns.** Take practical measures to change the tendency among some listed companies to focus on listing over restructuring and on financing over returns; raise overall quality and provide investors with opportunities to share in economic growth and increase wealth.  
— **Encourage compliant funds to enter the market.** Continue to develop securities investment funds. Support insurance funds in directly investing in the market in various ways; gradually raise the proportion of social security funds, enterprise annuities, and commercial insurance funds invested in the market. Foster a cohort of honest, law-abiding, professional institutional investors—making fund managers and insurers the market’s leading forces.  
— **Broaden securities firms’ financing channels.** Continue supporting eligible firms to raise long-term funds via equity or bond issuance. Improve rules for pledge loans and access to the interbank market; set standards for M&A and underwriting-related loans; under sound risk control, create favorable conditions for prudent use of loans. Steadily pilot financing for fund management companies.  
— **Address split-share structures prudently.** Regulate transfers of non-tradable shares and prevent state-asset losses. Address the circulation of currently non-tradable shares in a steady manner, respecting market laws, supporting stability and development, and protecting investors—especially public investors.  
— **Refine tax policies.** Study and introduce tax policies that encourage public investment; improve turnover and income-tax administration for securities and futures firms; where conditions permit, implement centralized income-tax administration.

Formulate and improve rules on issuance, trading, disclosure, and ratings; strengthen collateral and guarantees. Gradually build a centrally supervised, interconnected bond market.

## V. Further raise listed-company quality and advance standardized operations

— **Improve quality.** The value of the securities market stems from the quality of listed companies. Directors and senior executives must maximize shareholder interests and steadily raise profitability. Further improve offering administration, implement a sponsor system, and support competitive, well-run, profitable companies in going public to enhance quality at the source. Encourage market-oriented M&A conducive to sustainable development. Improve refinancing policy and support quality listed firms in leveraging the market to grow stronger.

Strengthen disclosure obligations of listed companies and other liable parties to ensure truthful, accurate, complete, and timely information. Establish sound incentive and restraint mechanisms for executives.

Encourage growth via M&A and integration, and establish market-exit mechanisms.  
— **Strengthen oversight of other intermediaries.** Regulate the development of investment advisors and credit-rating agencies; tighten management of accounting, legal, and asset-valuation institutions; and raise professional service quality.

## VII. Strengthen the legal and integrity framework and raise supervisory capacity

Clean up administrative and local regulations, departmental rules, and policy documents that impede development, thereby creating a sound legal environment. Formulate market integrity codes, maintain order, and decisively bar institutions and individuals with egregious violations or serious bad faith.  
— **Advance law-based administration and strengthen supervision.** In line with administrative-approval reform and the *Administrative Licensing Law*, improve the caliber and capacity of enforcers. Update supervisory concepts, establish approaches suited to the stage of market development,完善 tools, and raise efficiency. Further bolster supervisory forces, integrate resources, and build a politically and professionally strong team. Through effective oversight, raise fairness, transparency, and efficiency; lower systemic risk; and safeguard participants’ rights.  
— **Leverage self-discipline and public oversight.** Give full play to the self-regulation of exchanges, the depository and clearing company, industry associations in securities and futures, and professional associations for lawyers, accountants, and valuers. Guide and strengthen the media’s role in publicity and supervision.

## VIII. Strengthen coordination and guard against and defuse risks

— **Foster a favorable environment.** Risk prevention in the capital market bears on financial security and healthy economic development. All regions and departments must support规范 development; when introducing policies related to the market, fully consider its sensitivity, complexity, and particularity; and establish mechanisms for information sharing, smooth communication, clear accountability, and coordination to create good conditions for stable development.  
— **Jointly prevent and defuse risks.** All regions and departments must fulfill duties under the *Company Law* and other laws; take effective measures to prevent and promptly rectify false capital contributions by promoters and asset misappropriation by controlling shareholders or actual controllers; and strengthen lawful oversight of delisted firms to ensure orderly delisting. For securities and futures companies with major operational risks that must exit the market or face other administrative measures, local governments, financial regulators, and public-security and judicial organs shall coordinate and, pursuant to laws and policies, take active and effective steps in risk disposal. All regions and departments must establish rapid-response mechanisms for market contingencies and long-term mechanisms for risk prevention and resolution.  
— **Crack down on violations.** Implement the State Council’s directives on rectifying and regulating market order; strictly prohibit illegal securities issuance; illegal establishment of securities/futures firms; illegal brokerage of securities/futures; illegal or disguised establishment of trading venues; and other violations. Fiscal, public-security, audit, and market-regulation departments and state-asset supervisors shall strengthen coordination, intensify enforcement, and maintain market order.

## IX. Summarize experience and advance opening-up prudently

— **Honor WTO commitments on opening the securities services sector.** Encourage qualified foreign institutions to take equity stakes in securities firms and fund managers, and continue the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) program.

Vigorously developing the capital market is a major decision of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council from an overall and strategic perspective. All regions and departments must attach great importance, adopt a whole-of-government perspective, fully recognize its significance, strengthen confidence, seize opportunities, and innovate—jointly creating conditions to promote reform, opening-up, and the stable development of China’s capital market, and contributing to the grand goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects.
