# Opinions on Accelerating the Development of Animal Husbandry in State Farms

To the animal husbandry authorities of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government; the General Office of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps; and relevant directly affiliated units of the Ministry:

Animal husbandry in state farms is an important component of state farm agriculture and the state farm economy. Since the launch of reform and opening up, animal husbandry in state farms has made great strides. Its proportion within the broader agricultural sector has increased markedly; a number of leading enterprises with strong capabilities and well-known brands have been cultivated and expanded; and a modern industrial chain—characterized by close benefit linkages, wide coverage, and strong driving power—has been established. Animal husbandry has become an important pillar supporting the economic development of certain reclamation areas, playing an increasingly vital role in the rapid growth of the state farm economy, in increasing workers’ incomes, and in maintaining social stability. After decades of continuous development, state farm animal husbandry enjoys superior resource and ecological conditions, relatively large production scale, a solid foundation in improved breeds, and a high level of husbandry technology, with significant potential for further development. In light of the requirements for developing modern agriculture in the new era, the following opinions are hereby put forward on accelerating the development of state farm animal husbandry in the coming years:

## I. Necessity and Feasibility of Accelerating the Development of State Farm Animal Husbandry

### (1) Necessity of Accelerating Development

1. **An important task in the new stage of agricultural development.** As agricultural modernization advances, the share of animal husbandry in agricultural output and the level of consumption have become key indicators for measuring a country’s or region’s comprehensive agricultural production capacity and degree of affluence. Vigorously developing state farm animal husbandry to promote deeper and broader progress in agriculture, and to open state farm agriculture to the outside world to a greater extent, is conducive to leveraging the comparative advantages of state farm agriculture.

2. **A means for workers to become prosperous and achieve a “moderately prosperous” life.** By guiding broad participation of workers in animal husbandry, related industries such as processing, storage, production services, and transportation can be stimulated, thereby forming regional pillar industries and transforming regional resource advantages into economic advantages. This helps create new employment channels, increase job opportunities, and achieve the goal of raising workers’ incomes and attaining a “moderately prosperous” standard of living.

3. **A requirement for improving overall agricultural efficiency and ensuring sustainable development.** Vigorously developing animal husbandry enables a more rational and efficient allocation of agricultural resources in state farms, effectively converting large quantities of grain and by-products, and driving the development of crop farming, the feed industry, slaughtering and processing, and related sectors. This results in multiple value additions for agricultural products, enhances overall agricultural efficiency, and promotes the sustainable development of state farm agriculture.

4. **A necessity for giving play to the demonstrative and driving role of state farms in building modern agriculture.** Through long-term practice and exploration, state farms have been at the forefront nationwide in building modern agriculture and are well positioned to play a demonstrative and catalytic role. With resource support and potential for rapid development of animal husbandry, channeling land, capital, technology, and surplus labor into animal husbandry will help form a market-oriented modern agricultural industrial structure, enhance overall agricultural management levels, further strengthen the position of state farm agriculture in the national agricultural economy, and better leverage the demonstrative and driving role of state farm animal husbandry in building modern agriculture.

### (2) Feasibility of Accelerating Development

State farms have become important domestic production bases for large-scale, comprehensive agricultural commodity operations and possess favorable conditions for large-scale development of animal husbandry:  
**First, resource advantages.** The northeastern and northwestern reclamation areas are located in pastoral and agro-pastoral transition zones where livestock resources are abundant, making them among the country’s key regions for developing animal husbandry. The eastern and central reclamation areas have rare water resources suitable for aquaculture and specialty breeding.  
**Second, technological advantages.** State farms have relatively advanced scientific and technological capacity and a sound extension system. New technologies are disseminated quickly and effectively, facilitating the integrated application of modern feed and nutrition technology, disease prevention and control technology, product marketing and processing technology, and modern enterprise management techniques.  
**Third, organizational advantages.** State farms have a high degree of organization, abundant talent, and clear management advantages, with rich experience in standardized breeding, standardized operations and management, quality control, and disease prevention, which will play an even greater role in future development.  
**Fourth, leading enterprises.** The system boasts a number of powerful leading enterprises with strong brands and wide influence in the processing of livestock and aquatic products, and a number of new modern processing enterprises for livestock and aquatic products are under construction, which will provide important guarantees for value-added conversion of animal husbandry products.

At the same time, problems and deficiencies remain: overall, the number of strong leading enterprises with well-known brands is limited; operational systems and mechanisms lack vitality; the product structure is irrational, with a predominance of primary products and a relative scarcity of high–technology, deep-processed products; service systems are incomplete; informatization systems have not taken shape; strong marketing networks are lacking and marketing methods are outdated; the share of animal husbandry within the broader agricultural sector is too low and development is uneven. These conditions are far from meeting the requirements of modern agricultural development, and do not align with the strategic adjustment of the agricultural structure or the comprehensive goal of building a moderately prosperous society. It is urgent to further clarify thinking and adopt effective measures to accelerate development.

## II. Approaches, Targets, and Principles for the Development of State Farm Animal Husbandry

### (1) Development Approach

For the period ahead, the approach to developing state farm animal husbandry is: guided by the market, centered on economic benefits, and oriented toward safety and quality; innovate systems and mechanisms; leverage the resource, technological, and organizational advantages of state farms; advance industrialized operations centered on leading enterprises; implement regionalized layouts and scaled, standardized breeding; strengthen fundamental work on improved breeds, disease control, services, and science and technology; achieve rapid development of animal husbandry in state farms; substantially increase its share within the broader agricultural sector; better play the demonstrative and driving role of state farms; and promote the development of modern agriculture in state farms and the realization of the comprehensive goal of building a moderately prosperous society.

### (2) Development Targets

By **2007**, the development targets for animal husbandry in the state farm system are:

- **Breeding system:** In accordance with market-economy requirements, form a relatively complete breeding stock and seed production system; build a number of large-scale breeding bases for superior livestock and poultry and national-level breeding bases with leading domestic positions. Through introduction and selection of superior new varieties and expanded promotion of improved breeds, achieve **100% coverage** of improved breeds across the state farm system.

- **Processing capacity:** Increase the proportion of processed livestock and aquatic products; expand the scale of leading enterprises; enhance their core competitiveness and driving and radiating capacities; and continuously improve processing levels and efficiency.

- **Disease control:** Establish relatively complete animal disease prevention and control systems, supporting systems for disease control, and key disease control mechanisms, so that comprehensive prevention and control technologies for animal diseases reach or approach the levels of advanced countries, and form a robust and effective protection system.

- **Economic indicators:** By **2007**, achieve a gross output value of animal husbandry of **33.1 billion yuan**, with an average annual growth rate of **9%**; raise its share of the broader agricultural sector to **33% or more**, and in key reclamation areas to **over 50%**, thereby achieving “half of the landscape” or a “role reversal” between crop farming and animal husbandry, making the agricultural structure more rational and turning animal husbandry into a pillar industry for reclamation area economies.

### (3) Basic Principles

1. **Market orientation.** Adhere to economic efficiency as the core; be rooted in local markets while targeting the broader domestic and international markets; accelerate development of husbandry products that meet market demand; cultivate and build brand advantages for state farm products. Study and discern market trends, actively develop new markets, and use high-quality, name-brand state farm products to capture market share at home and abroad, to the greatest extent meeting the needs of different regions and consumption levels.

2. **Adaptation to local conditions and emphasis on advantages.** Based on the conditions of farms and reclamation areas, leverage resource, technological, and ecological advantages; provide classified guidance; make rational layouts; actively develop advantageous husbandry products with state farm characteristics; and form husbandry industry belts with regional features. In determining key projects, adhere to scientific attitudes based on actual conditions while emancipating the mind, boldly innovating, and accelerating development.

3. **Quality and safety first.** Uphold the principle that quality and food safety come first. Through the dissemination of applicable technologies and the application of high technologies, realize standardized production; establish traceable accountability; provide high-quality, safe products to the market; and win consumer trust.

4. **Coordinated development.** From the overall perspective of reclamation area economic development, emphasize coordination among industries—within animal husbandry, between animal husbandry and crop farming, between animal husbandry and processing, and between animal husbandry and the overall state farm economy—striving to explore a path of sustainable development in husbandry with state farm characteristics.

## III. Priorities for Accelerating the Development of State Farm Animal Husbandry

Based on the current foundation of development, resource conditions in the reclamation areas, and domestic and international demand for livestock and aquatic products, the priorities are:

### (1) Focus on Advantageous Industries and Varieties

**Dairy industry.** In accordance with the *Plan for the Development of Advantageous Regions for the Dairy Industry* of the Ministry of Agriculture, strengthen milk source base construction in the advantageous dairy regions of Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia in the northeast, in Shanxi and Hebei in North China, and in the Beijing–Tianjin–Shanghai metropolitan areas. Pay attention to developing dairy production in the suburbs of small and medium-sized cities and build a number of high-level premium milk source bases. Leverage the technological advantages of reclamation areas and fine genetic resources of dairy cattle to accelerate breed improvement and breeding of superior stock; alleviate the shortage of cattle sources and the limited number of improved dairy cattle; and continuously raise herd quality and production levels in reclamation areas and nationwide.

**Hogs.** In line with varied market demand and the needs of pig production, focus on improving breeding stock quality by building nucleus breeding farms and multiplication farms; actively introduce superior domestic and foreign breeds; optimize herd structure; increase the proportion of high-quality breeding pigs; and produce high-quality market hogs. Export bases in Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Henan, and other provinces should upgrade equipment, implement standardized, regulated, factory-style production measures, and expand export shares. Fully leverage organizational advantages to restructure and integrate pig production, building pig industry groups that combine breeding stock, market hogs, feed production, product marketing, and services. Produce according to non-harmful standards to meet rising food safety requirements.

**Beef cattle and sheep.** Determine production regions and layouts for beef cattle and mutton sheep in light of breeding stock resources, feed resources, and industrial foundations. Focus on supporting enterprises engaged in industrialized operations; implement scaled production and standardized management; and target key constraints such as breed improvement, product quality grading, and product quality safety, striving for significant development in beef and mutton production.

**Fine-wool sheep.** According to the needs of the domestic wool textile industry, emphasize production of high-quality fine-wool sheep. While steadily increasing herd size, strengthen breed improvement; establish bases for fine-wool sheep; raise levels of intensive feeding; and endeavor to increase production of premium wool. Promote technologies such as mechanical shearing, grading and sorting, and mechanical baling to ensure wool quality meets textile industry requirements, thereby improving the overall fine-sheep sector.

**Poultry.** To meet domestic, especially export, demand, strengthen the breeding poultry system and accelerate variety renewal. Support leading enterprises in the poultry industry within reclamation areas; adopt new technologies, equipment, and processes; and raise industrialization levels. Waterfowl such as geese and ducks are focal points with considerable market potential; expedite the introduction and breeding of varieties and rapidly expand production scale and performance.

**Aquaculture.** In line with domestic and international market demand, optimize species structure. While steadily developing mass aquaculture species, concentrate on premium, specialty, high-quality, and novel products. Prioritize the construction of production bases for quality fry and fingerlings; promote factory-based aquaculture technologies; and comprehensively improve product quality. Utilize offshore waters, lakes, and reservoirs to develop cage, enclosure, and pen culture, and actively develop deep-sea cage aquaculture. Support leading enterprises in aquatic product processing; apply modern technologies to produce various flavored foods; develop aquatic products for medical and health uses; and increase the share of processed aquatic products.

**Specialty breeding.** Make full use of existing and introduced varieties; accelerate selection and breeding; and strengthen the construction of breeding bases for cashmere goats, sika deer, red deer, Chinese soft-shelled turtle, sturgeon, zoea-stage crab seedlings, bullfrogs, ostriches, and others, further improving production levels and degrees of industrialization and commercialization.

### (2) Promote Scaled Operations

In accordance with the requirements of building modern agriculture, prioritize the development of multi-form, multi-level scaled breeding:  
**First, support large-scale breeders.** Create enabling conditions to guide and support farm workers in scaled breeding, developing a number of high-standard scaled farms (households) that can play a demonstrative role.  
**Second, build scaled breeding zones.** Based on priority species, and on sound planning and rational layouts, construct scaled breeding zones for dairy cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry, and aquaculture. Combine household-based breeding with unified organizational services to help breeders solve problems of production technology, feed supply, disease prevention, and market access.  
**Third, develop factory-style breeding.** In reclamation areas and farms with the requisite conditions, actively develop joint-stock and private factory-style farms, drawing on foreign experience, equipping advanced machinery, applying high technologies, and implementing scientific management to explore and refine high-tech, high-efficiency breeding models.  
**Fourth, form advantageous regions and industrial belts.** Through diverse forms of scaled breeding within reclamation areas or across selected farms, create advantageous regions or industrial belts closely linked with leading enterprises and specialized markets, and markedly enhance the scale, intensiveness, and technological level of state farm animal husbandry.

### (3) Strengthen the Breeding and Propagation System for Improved Varieties

Building on the achievements already made in the improved livestock and poultry system, focus on:  
**First, consolidating and raising breeding and technological levels.** Give full play to the productive capacity and diffusion role of existing breeding centers and farms (stations); expeditiously establish a livestock and poultry breeding system comprising breeding centers, nucleus farms, multiplication farms, and commercial stock farms; and expand supply capacity and coverage of superior varieties.  
**Second, introducing and multiplying improved breeds.** Actively introduce and propagate new breeds of dairy cattle, pigs, sheep, and others to enhance production capacity and product quality.  
**Third, consolidating and improving the performance testing system.** With regional centralized testing as the mainstay, strengthen breed and performance testing of breeding stock to serve the construction of breeding systems in state farms and rural areas. Through system building, increase the output of quality products, raise the industrialization level of improved breeds, further improve coverage, open domestic and international markets for breeding stock, and substantially enhance economic returns.

## IV. Major Measures to Accelerate Development

### (1) Implement a “Leading Enterprise” Strategy to Raise the Level of Industrialization

Cultivating and expanding leading enterprises, fully leveraging their driving roles, and achieving integration of breeding, processing, production, supply, and marketing to form a modern industrial chain with strong traction and sound operation are crucial measures for accelerating development and raising industrialization levels.  
**First,** based on local priorities and specific projects, expand enterprise scale through reorganization, mergers, restructuring, and alliances; optimize capital and organizational structures; and grow stronger leading enterprises, forming diversified industrial-chain forms such as “leading enterprise + base + households.”  
**Second,** draw lessons from past uniform, state-owned/operated models characterized by rigid mechanisms and weak competitiveness. Whether existing or newly established, leading enterprises must adopt corporate forms aligned with modern enterprise systems—such as multi-investor joint-stock or private companies—to achieve institutional and mechanistic innovation and invigorate both enterprises and the entire chain.  
**Third,** foster and strengthen brand awareness. Building on existing well-known state farm brands, focus on improving management, increasing investment, and cultivating staff quality and brand consciousness to forge, through sustained effort, new name-brand products and enterprises and expand market share.  
**Fourth,** based on industrial characteristics and intra-industry division of labor, pursue cross-system, cross-industry, and cross–reclamation area cooperation tied by property rights or benefit linkages; expand reach through multiple forms; extend the industrial chain; strengthen linkages among segments; and perfect and enhance the level of industrialization.  
**Fifth,** based on actual conditions, adopt multiple business and organizational models—such as “company + households,” collective or joint-stock farms, and private scaled farms—to build breeding bases and realize scaled operations and modernized production.

### (2) Build an Efficient and Safe Feed Production System

Providing safe animal-based foods to the market is a fundamental goal of state farm animal husbandry, and feed safety is a critical foundation for product safety as well as a key guarantee of product quality reputation. Therefore, building efficient and safe feed production should be a priority:  
**First,** in line with development needs, accelerate the feed processing industry, strengthen grassland resource management and development, adopt comprehensive measures to improve rangelands, promote animal husbandry through grass cultivation, and advance industrialization of high-quality forage to meet the needs of animal husbandry and the market.  
**Second,** strictly implement national standards on livestock and poultry production, rearing, and environmental protection; resolutely eliminate illegal manufacture and misuse of feed additives; remove safety hazards in feed production; and ensure quality and safety of animal husbandry products.

### (3) Strengthen Animal Disease Prevention and Control Systems

By **2007**, focusing on building disease-free zones, accelerate the implementation of animal protection projects, control disease transmission, and reduce morbidity and mortality:  
**First,** strengthen animal disease prevention and control systems by improving and consolidating farm veterinary stations, streamlining management structures, enhancing technical staffing, and raising diagnostic capacity.  
**Second,** strengthen animal epidemic monitoring and reporting. Establish epidemic analysis and forecasting centers in key reclamation areas to collect, analyze, and handle epidemics; strictly enforce monitoring and reporting; and strengthen prevention and control, focusing on immunization, quarantine, and treatment of common diseases to reduce incidence, network the prevention and control of major diseases across reclamation areas, enable rapid diagnosis, and swiftly extinguish outbreaks.  
**Third,** in response to new situations in managing major animal diseases, reclamation areas and farms shall formulate emergency plans, ensure reserves of emergency supplies and funds, and, in accordance with State provisions, implement compulsory immunization, compulsory monitoring, compulsory disinfection, and treatment.  
**Fourth,** intensify the development and application of disease prevention and control technologies to quickly overcome outdated and inadequate comprehensive control methods.  
**Fifth,** conscientiously implement Ministry of Agriculture Decree No. 13 and fully enforce the animal immunization identification system.

### (4) Promote “Revitalizing Animal Husbandry Through Science and Technology” to Raise Technological Levels

Scientific and technological progress is the fundamental engine of development. Reclamation areas should give full play to existing advantages, take “revitalizing animal husbandry through science and technology” as a guiding principle, and truly shift to a development path primarily driven by technological advances:  
**First,** continue deepening reforms and innovation in research and extension systems; optimize allocation of S&T resources; cultivate innovation主体; and enhance independent innovation capacity.  
**Second,** establish and improve demonstration and extension systems; strengthen extension of new technologies; prioritize the breeding of new varieties, embryo transfer, feed processing, scaled operations, standardized breeding, and comprehensive disease prevention and control; and accelerate integration and matching of mature technologies. Where conditions permit, build a number of high-standard modern farms to explore experiences and enhance demonstrations.  
**Third,** closely track the latest domestic and international scientific and technological developments; introduce, digest, and absorb advanced technologies and equipment; strengthen research and application of new achievements; and advance technological progress so that growth shifts from primarily producing primary commodities to supplying improved, high-quality, and high–precision products, further raising the contribution of science and technology.

### (5) Strengthen Market Systems Related to Product Marketing

To promote circulation of animal husbandry products and reduce and hedge market risks, it is necessary to strengthen market systems related to marketing:  
**First,** continue developing various forms of primary markets; reclamation areas with conditions may also build origin wholesale and specialized markets to provide comprehensive services for circulation of state farm and local products.  
**Second,** determine market positioning based on product characteristics; formulate marketing strategies; improve marketing methods; and engage in various forms of cooperation with local enterprises to create mutually beneficial development.  
**Third,** actively cultivate and develop intermediary organizations; encourage professional associations, production cooperatives, technical service organizations, and circulation cooperatives to participate in market building; and encourage circulation forms such as production–marketing linkages, chain operations, futures trading, and e-commerce to broaden channels.  
**Fourth,** strengthen informatization and information services; establish a responsive modern market information transmission and service network for animal husbandry; and promptly reflect supply–demand and price changes to guide development and business decisions.  
**Fifth,** establish and improve product quality management systems; implement standardized production; and, in accordance with national market access systems for livestock products, supply high-quality and safe products.

### (6) Strengthen Environmental and Ecological Development

Conscientiously implement the *Grassland Law of the People’s Republic of China* and the State Council’s *Several Opinions on Strengthening Grassland Protection and Development*. In view of overgrazing and the worsening grassland ecology in some areas, decisive measures must be taken to protect grassland ecosystems, improve ecological conditions as soon as possible, and lay a foundation for sustainable development:  
**First,** adopt comprehensive measures such as enclosure and conservation, prohibition of grazing with stall feeding, pasture improvement, desertification and salinization control, and returning farmland to grassland to restore vegetation; resolutely curb ecological degradation; and gradually restore productivity.  
**Second,** strengthen grassland development by building forage seed breeding and propagation bases, feed and forage bases, artificial pastures, and aerial seeding, thereby increasing vegetation coverage and forage yields and establishing a sustainable, benign ecological system.  
**Third,** crack down in accordance with law on acts that damage grasslands; promptly handle cases of illicit digging, harvesting, and reclamation; and strengthen protection and management. Implement grassland fire prevention responsibility systems, establish fire monitoring and communications institutions, and prevent and control rodent, insect, and poisonous weed hazards.  
**Fourth,** strengthen management and comprehensive utilization of livestock and poultry manure to prevent environmental pollution and damage.

## V. Strengthen Leadership and Create an Enabling Environment

Accelerating the development of state farm animal husbandry concerns the strategic adjustment of the industrial structure in the new era and the realization of modern agriculture and the goal of building a moderately prosperous society. Leading cadres at all levels in the reclamation areas should change mindsets, take the development of animal husbandry as a key task in future agricultural work, strengthen leadership, make holistic plans and comprehensive deployments, mobilize all forces, ensure implementation, and create an enabling environment and atmosphere.  
**First,** strengthen leadership and staffing of animal husbandry and fishery departments, give full play to their roles in professional guidance, organization, coordination, and industry management, and provide necessary conditions for their normal work.  
**Second,** formulate policies conducive to accelerating development, and offer preferential treatment regarding breeding sites, feed cultivation areas, and rangelands.  
**Third,** seek financial services such as investment attraction and financing for building leading enterprises and large-scale farms (households).  
**Fourth,** strengthen industry training and management, and build a high-quality scientific and technological workforce in animal husbandry and aquaculture that meets the needs of rapid development.
