# Opinions of the Ministry of Agriculture on Implementing the “Opinions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Vigorously Developing Modern Agriculture and Solidly Advancing the Construction of a New Socialist Countryside”

To: Departments (Bureaus, Commissions, Offices) of Agriculture, Agricultural Machinery, Animal Husbandry, Veterinary Affairs, State Farms, Township Enterprises, and Fisheries of all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and cities with independent development plans; Agricultural Bureau of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps:

To fully implement the *Opinions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Vigorously Developing Modern Agriculture and Solidly Advancing the Construction of a New Socialist Countryside* (Zhongfa [2007] No. 1, hereinafter the “No. 1 Central Document”), the following opinions are hereby put forward. Please act in light of local realities and see to thorough implementation.

## I. Fully Recognize the Great Significance of Vigorously Developing Modern Agriculture and Solidly Advancing the New Socialist Countryside, and Clarify the Guiding Principles for Work

**(1) Accurately assess the current situation of agriculture and the rural economy.**  
In recent years, agricultural authorities at all levels have earnestly implemented central directives and steadily promoted the building of a new socialist countryside, achieving remarkable results. Grain output increased for three consecutive years; farmers’ incomes rose rapidly for three straight years; rural sectors developed in a steady and coordinated manner; operational quality in agriculture and the rural economy improved steadily; new progress was made in preventing and controlling major animal diseases such as avian influenza and foot-and-mouth disease. This favorable situation has strongly supported stable and rapid national economic growth. At the same time, agriculture and the rural economy remain in a difficult climbing stage: the agricultural foundation is weak; facilities and equipment lag behind; maintaining steady grain growth and sustained income increases for farmers is growing more difficult; and the tasks facing agricultural and rural work are very demanding.

**(2) Fully understand the great significance of vigorously developing modern agriculture.**  
Agricultural development concerns the broader landscape of the national economy and social development: when agriculture prospers, the foundation is strong; when farmers are well-off, the country thrives; when the countryside is stable, society is at peace. Vigorously developing modern agriculture is the concrete application of the Scientific Outlook on Development to agricultural and rural work; it is the top priority for building a new socialist countryside; it is the fundamental path to stabilizing grain production and sustaining farmers’ income growth; and it is the necessary route to sustainable agricultural development. Agricultural authorities at all levels should, from a strategic and holistic perspective, fully appreciate its significance, analyze the new situation, accurately understand the scientific connotation of modern agriculture, clarify goals and tasks, grasp the characteristics and laws of China’s modernization of agriculture, and blaze a path to agricultural modernization with Chinese characteristics.

**(3) Take building modern agriculture as the focus of agricultural and rural economic work.**  
Developing modern agriculture is the overarching theme and an important responsibility of agricultural authorities. In 2007, work on agriculture and the rural economy should be guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of the “Three Represents”; fully implement the spirit of the Fifth and Sixth Plenary Sessions of the 16th CPC Central Committee, as well as the Central Economic Work Conference and the Central Rural Work Conference; uphold the Scientific Outlook on Development; focus on developing modern agriculture; continue to implement the three strategies of “transformation, expansion, and upgrading”; and strive to strengthen the four pillars of policy, science and technology, facilities and equipment, and talent. Efforts should be made to build six industrial systems: premium grain, efficient cash crops and horticulture, healthy animal husbandry and aquaculture, agricultural industrialization and agro-processing, biomass and ecological industries, and agricultural services. Consolidate and expand the favorable situation in agriculture and the rural economy, with the goal of keeping total grain output no lower than the previous year and increasing per capita net income of farmers by more than 5%. Agricultural authorities at all levels should clarify working ideas, focus on priorities, formulate concrete plans and supporting measures, and organize effective implementation.

## II. Conscientiously Implement Policies that Support Agriculture and Benefit Farmers, and Protect and Mobilize Farmers’ Initiative to Build Modern Agriculture

**(4) Unswervingly uphold the basic rural management system.**  
Stabilize and improve the rural land contracting system. Accelerate follow-up work after contract extensions and resolve prominent problems in land contracting, ensuring that land contract-management right certificates are issued to all households. Stabilize fishermen’s use rights to waters and tidal flats and strengthen the issuance of aquaculture certificates. Improve mechanisms for the transfer of land contract-management rights on a law-based, voluntary, and compensated basis; localities with the right conditions may develop appropriately scaled operations in various forms. Advance arbitration pilots for land contract disputes, promote legislation on arbitration, and establish sound mechanisms to properly address issues arising from land contracting. Proactively advance reform of the land expropriation system and explore effective ways to ensure both current and long-term interests of farmers.

**(5) Intensify the implementation of policies that support and benefit agriculture.**  
Actively secure fiscal and credit funds supporting agriculture, and increase inputs into building modern agriculture. Improve and effectively implement direct grain subsidies and comprehensive input subsidies for agricultural means of production; expand the implementation of superior seed subsidies and subsidies for purchasing agricultural machinery. Implement minimum purchase price policies for key regions and major grain varieties, and work to improve and institutionalize such policies. Strengthen the management and use of agricultural support funds, including public tendering, subsidy disclosure, and direct-to-household payments, to ensure that benefits reach farmers. Coordinate agricultural projects and funding arrangements, increase auditing and oversight, establish necessary penalties, and improve project efficiency.

**(6) Continue to reduce farmers’ burdens.**  
Establish, improve, and strictly enforce systems to lighten farmers’ burdens; expand comprehensive governance; address issues strongly reported by farmers; and explore long-term mechanisms to prevent burden rebound. Improve the “one matter, one discussion” system for village-level fund-raising and labor contributions; strengthen publicity, training, guidance, and supervision; implement award-and-subsidy policies for public-welfare facilities built under this system; and actively develop small-scale rural public-welfare infrastructure. Consolidate tax-and-fee reform achievements in state farms and effectively reduce burdens on agricultural employees.

**(7) Actively participate in rural social security and agricultural insurance.**  
Actively explore the establishment of a social security system covering both urban and rural residents, and promote the establishment of a rural minimum living standard scheme nationwide. In line with the principles of government guidance, policy support, market operation, and farmer voluntariness, promote an improved agricultural insurance system. Advance legislation on policy-based agricultural insurance and expand pilot programs. Encourage leading enterprises and intermediaries to organize farmers to participate in insurance. Push forward rural financial reform, promote rural credit guarantee funds or institutions, and ease financing difficulties for households and rural SMEs.
