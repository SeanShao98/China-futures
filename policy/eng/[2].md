**The State Council’s Notice on Forwarding the Report of the Ministry of Commerce and Seven Other Departments Regarding the Pilot Program of the Zhengzhou Grain Wholesale Market**

Guo Fa [1990] No. 46

To the People’s Governments of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, as well as all ministries and commissions of the State Council and all directly affiliated institutions:

The State Council has approved the “Report on the Pilot Program of the Zhengzhou Grain Wholesale Market” submitted by the Ministry of Commerce and seven other departments. It is hereby forwarded to you for careful study and implementation.

The pilot program of the Zhengzhou Grain Wholesale Market is an important attempt to deepen the reform of the grain circulation system. It covers a wide range of areas and involves strong policy considerations. The Ministry of Commerce and the People’s Government of Henan Province must work in close cooperation, strengthen leadership, promptly study and resolve issues arising during the pilot process, and take responsibility for formulating and implementing the trading rules of the Zhengzhou Grain Wholesale Market. Relevant local governments and departments of the State Council must actively provide support, closely coordinate, and jointly ensure the successful establishment of the Zhengzhou Grain Wholesale Market.

The State Council

**Report on the Pilot Program of the Zhengzhou Grain Wholesale Market**

To the State Council:

According to the requirements set forth in the State Council’s “Decision on Strengthening Grain Management and Stabilizing the Grain Market” (Guo Fa [1988] No. 67), which stipulates that “grain wholesale markets should be gradually established to organize market regulation in an orderly manner” and that “inter-provincial transfers must be concluded in the market, with prices determined by supply and demand,” we consulted domestic experts, solicited opinions from relevant departments, and conducted special discussions during the National Summer Grain Conference on the issue of piloting a grain wholesale market in Zhengzhou, Henan Province. We now report the situation and opinions as follows.

At present, approximately 60 billion kilograms of commodity grain fall outside of state contract procurement each year (i.e., traded grain), of which more than 15 billion kilograms is wheat. However, the purchase and sale of negotiated grain lacks organized, regulated wholesale markets, as well as planned guidance and macro-level regulation. The grain market often falls into disorder, with serious problems such as hoarding, monopolistic blockades, price gouging, and speculative reselling. The remedy is to incorporate negotiated grain into standardized wholesale markets, rectify grain trading practices, regulate enterprise behavior, establish market order, and achieve the principle of “management without stagnation, vitality without disorder.” Therefore, through pilot programs, it has become both urgent and necessary to establish grain wholesale markets in China. The purpose of piloting a wheat wholesale market in Zhengzhou is to gradually incorporate inter-provincial negotiated wheat into wholesale market transactions. The first step is to require all negotiated wheat transferred out of Henan Province to be traded in the market, along with a portion of the negotiated wheat transferred out of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hubei. The second step is to require all inter-provincial transfers of negotiated wheat to be conducted through the market. The trial period is tentatively set at three years. The specific opinions regarding the Zhengzhou Grain Wholesale Market are as follows:

1. The management body of the Zhengzhou Grain Wholesale Market shall be a non-profit service institution included in Henan Province’s administrative establishment. Service fees collected by the market shall be turned over to the provincial finance. Market construction should be simple and pragmatic. The initial start-up costs and operational shortfalls shall be borne by the People’s Government of Henan Province, with the Ministry of Commerce providing certain subsidies during the initial stage of the pilot.

2. The prices of wheat entering the Zhengzhou Grain Wholesale Market (including purchase, wholesale, and retail prices) shall be subject to maximum and minimum price limits set jointly by the Ministry of Commerce and the State Price Bureau based on supply-demand conditions and relevant national policies. Specific trading prices shall be determined through open competition in the market. The Zhengzhou Wholesale Market may regulate prices by setting fluctuation ranges, imposing purchase quotas, or using wheat stockpiles. Transactions shall be deemed invalid if the market prices exceed the upper limit or fall below the lower limit.

3. For wheat transacted in the Zhengzhou Grain Wholesale Market, the market management body shall issue transport permits, which transportation authorities must honor. For wheat with valid permits, no local government at any level may impose blockades at provincial borders.

4. Grain wholesale enterprises entering the Zhengzhou Grain Wholesale Market are strictly prohibited from conducting off-market wholesale transactions in Zhengzhou. Violators shall be punished in accordance with the market’s management regulations.

5. On the basis of spot wholesale transactions in the Zhengzhou Grain Wholesale Market, forward contracts may be transferred within the market in accordance with market regulations, but they must be strictly separated from spot trading.
