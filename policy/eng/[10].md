# **Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Vigorously Developing Modern Agriculture and Steadily Advancing the Building of a New Socialist Countryside**





*(December 31, 2006)*

**Zhong Fa [2007] No. 1**



Agricultural abundance strengthens the nation’s foundations; the prosperity of farmers enriches the country; and rural stability safeguards social peace. Strengthening work related to agriculture, rural areas, and farmers (the “three rurals”), vigorously developing modern agriculture, and steadily advancing the building of a new socialist countryside are essential for fully implementing the Scientific Outlook on Development, for building a socialist harmonious society, and for accelerating socialist modernization.



Since 2006, all regions and departments have earnestly implemented the decisions of the central authorities, and the building of a new socialist countryside has made a good start. Despite severe natural disasters, grain output has continued to grow, farmers’ incomes have kept rising, comprehensive rural reforms have progressed steadily, rural public undertakings have been visibly strengthened, and rural society has become more stable. Nevertheless, there remain prominent contradictions and problems in rural development: agricultural infrastructure is still weak; sustained income growth for farmers remains difficult; the development of rural social undertakings still lags behind; and changing the backward appearance of rural areas and narrowing the urban–rural gap will require arduous effort. We must heighten our sense of urgency; unwaveringly uphold the strategic principle that solving the “three rural” issues is the top priority of the entire Party; never relax in promoting stable agricultural development and sustained increases in farmers’ incomes; never weaken policies that support and benefit agriculture and farmers; and never slacken in the solid advancement of all tasks for building the new countryside.



Developing modern agriculture is the primary task in building the new socialist countryside and an inevitable requirement for leading rural work with the Scientific Outlook on Development. Advancing modern agriculture accords with the objective trend of China’s economic development and with the general laws of contemporary agricultural development worldwide. It is the fundamental path to increasing farmers’ incomes, an important measure to enhance comprehensive agricultural production capacity, and the industrial foundation for building the new socialist countryside. We must equip agriculture with modern material conditions, transform agriculture with modern science and technology, upgrade agriculture through modern industrial systems, advance agriculture with modern business forms, guide agriculture with modern development concepts, and develop agriculture by cultivating a new type of farmer. We must raise the levels of irrigation and water conservancy, mechanization, and informatization; increase land output rates, resource utilization rates, and agricultural labor productivity; and enhance the quality, efficiency, and competitiveness of agriculture. The process of building modern agriculture is the very process of transforming traditional agriculture and continuously developing rural productive forces, and of changing the mode of agricultural growth to promote sound and rapid development. We must regard the building of modern agriculture as a long-term and arduous task running through the entire process of new countryside construction and modernization, and carry it out with real resolve and concrete actions.



The overall requirements for agricultural and rural work in 2007 are as follows: guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory and the important thought of the “Three Represents,” fully implement the Scientific Outlook on Development; continue to treat the “three rural” issues as the top priority of the entire Party; coordinate urban and rural economic and social development; implement the policy of industry supporting agriculture, cities supporting the countryside, and “giving more, taking less, and loosening control”; consolidate, improve, and strengthen policies that support and benefit agriculture and farmers; substantially increase agricultural investment; actively promote the building of modern agriculture; strengthen rural public services; deepen comprehensive rural reform; promote stable grain development, sustained increases in farmers’ incomes, and greater rural harmony; ensure new progress in building the new countryside; and consolidate and expand the sound momentum in agriculture and rural areas.





## **I. Increase Investment in the “Three Rurals” and Establish an Investment Safeguard Mechanism to Promote Modern Agriculture**





Increasing agricultural investment is urgently needed to build modern agriculture and strengthen agricultural fundamentals. We must continually open new channels of agricultural investment and gradually form a diversified mechanism in which farmers actively raise funds and contribute labor, governments continually increase inputs, and social forces participate extensively. In particular, we must seize the current opportunity of rapid economic growth and rising fiscal revenues to further consolidate, improve, and strengthen policies that support and benefit agriculture and farmers, substantially increase investment in the “three rurals,” and deliver practical benefits to farmers.



1. **Substantially increase investment in the “three rurals.”** All levels of government must shift the focus of infrastructure construction and social undertakings toward rural areas. Increments in national fiscal expenditures for education, health, culture, and fixed-asset investment shall mainly be used in rural areas, and the share of government land transfer proceeds used in rural areas shall be gradually increased. A mechanism for the steady growth of “three rural” investment shall be established by actively adjusting the structures of fiscal expenditure, fixed-asset investment, and credit allocation. The annual growth in total agricultural inputs from central and sub-provincial (county level and above) finances shall exceed the growth in their regular fiscal revenues, so as to rapidly form stable funding sources for building the new countryside. In 2007, incremental fiscal inputs supporting agriculture shall continue to exceed those of the previous year; increments of national fixed-asset investment used in rural areas shall continue to exceed those of the previous year; and increments of land transfer proceeds used for rural construction shall continue to exceed those of the previous year. Additional revenues arising from higher taxes and fees on construction land shall be used primarily for the “three rurals.” The overall plan for rural financial reform shall be accelerated to form a rural financial system in which commercial finance, cooperative finance, policy finance, and microcredit organizations are complementary and functionally complete, and to explore various guarantee mechanisms that guide financial institutions to increase credit to the “three rurals.” We shall strengthen the integration of funds supporting agriculture; promptly establish mechanisms for aligning investment plans and departmental information-sharing; improve input management; and concentrate resources on key regions and projects to raise the efficiency of funds. Government funds must play a leveraging role, guiding farmers and all sectors of society to invest in rural construction. Agricultural investment legislation shall be accelerated and law enforcement inspections strengthened.
2. **Improve agricultural support and subsidy systems.** The subsidy policies implemented in recent years have been well received at the grassroots and among farmers; they must be consolidated, improved, and strengthened, gradually forming an agricultural subsidy system characterized by clear objectives, direct benefits, diverse types, and simple procedures. Funds used by localities for direct subsidies to grain growers shall reach more than 50% of grain risk funds. The intensity of improved seed subsidies shall be increased, and the scope and varieties subsidized shall be expanded. The scale, models, and scope of subsidies for the purchase of agricultural machinery shall be expanded. Comprehensive subsidies for agricultural production inputs shall be increased. The central finance shall increase rewards to major grain-producing counties and increase subsidies to financially strapped counties and townships to boost revenues and cut expenditures. At the same time, minimum purchase price policies shall continue to be implemented for key regions and major grain varieties, with measures gradually refined and systems improved.
3. **Establish agricultural risk prevention mechanisms.** We shall strengthen systems for forecasting and early warning, and emergency response to natural disasters and major plant and animal diseases and pests, enhancing disaster prevention and mitigation capacity in agriculture. We shall actively develop agricultural insurance and, under the principles of government guidance, policy support, market operation, and farmer voluntariness, establish and improve an agricultural insurance system. Pilot programs for policy-based agricultural insurance shall be expanded; all levels of finance shall subsidize premiums for farmers who purchase agricultural insurance; mechanisms for transferring and sharing catastrophic agricultural risks shall be improved; and a reinsurance system supported by both central and local finances shall be explored. Leading enterprises and intermediary organizations are encouraged to help farmers participate in agricultural insurance.
4. **Encourage farmers and social forces to invest in modern agriculture.** We shall fully leverage farmers’ principal role in building the new countryside and developing modern agriculture, guiding them to carry forward the spirit of self-reliance, increase production and intellectual inputs, and raise scientific farming and intensive management levels. Mechanisms for village-level “one matter, one discussion” fund-raising and labor contribution shall be improved, and localities shall be supported to implement reward-and-subsidy systems for public-interest projects funded under this mechanism. Appropriate subsidies may be granted to households that invest funds or labor to build production and living facilities from which they directly benefit. Through tax incentives, subsidies, equity participation, interest discounts, guarantees, and other means, we shall create a favorable environment for social forces to invest in modern agriculture. Enterprises that donate to or invest in rural public-interest facilities may enjoy corresponding tax preferences as prescribed.
