### III. Advance Comprehensive Supporting Reforms Centered on Enterprise Reform, and Gradually Establish the Dominant Position of the New Economic System

The long-term stable development of China’s economy fundamentally depends on the smooth advancement of economic system reform. Through phased and targeted comprehensive supporting reforms, we must accelerate the transformation of the economic operation mechanism and management system, thereby promoting the development of productive forces.

Deepening enterprise reform and enhancing the vitality of enterprises, especially large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises, is the core of the entire economic system reform. At present, the key lies in implementing various forms of contract management responsibility systems in accordance with the principle of separating ownership and management rights. Practice has proven that implementing contract management is an important means of invigorating the urban economy and can also create conditions for reforms in other areas. Following the principles of coordination, improvement, deepening, and development, we must continuously push forward enterprise management mechanism reform centered on the contract responsibility system, enabling enterprises to gradually move toward independent management and self-financing.

In deepening enterprise reform, first, we must actively introduce competition mechanisms, adopting bidding, selection, and democratic election to appoint the best candidates as enterprise managers or management groups, thereby cultivating a large contingent of capable managers proficient in scientific management. Second, enterprises must strengthen their internal foundations, fully implement the factory director responsibility system, improve internal accounting, and promote full-load operation methods and other effective systems according to their specific conditions. Democratic management within enterprises should be enhanced, and the workers’ congress system should be institutionalized, so that workers can fully play their role as masters of the enterprise and their initiative and creativity can be mobilized. This is indispensable for managing enterprises well. Third, we must actively promote horizontal cooperation among enterprises and vigorously develop enterprise groups. On a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis, enterprises are encouraged to contract, lease, or hold shares in each other, continue pilot programs of joint-stock systems, and promote reasonable adjustments to organizational and product structures. Fourth, conditional paid transfer of enterprise property rights should be implemented, so that idle or underutilized assets can be fully utilized.

While deepening the reform of enterprise management mechanisms, relevant comprehensive supporting reforms must also be advanced. The socialist market system should continue to develop, the integrated economic functions of cities should be enhanced, and the relationships among planning, finance, and banking should be basically rationalized, gradually establishing a macro-management system primarily based on indirect regulation.

Reform of the planning system should focus on transforming the functions of state planning agencies, gradually reducing mandatory planning, expanding indicative planning, emphasizing the formulation of medium- and long-term industrial policies, and ensuring comprehensive balance in major economic proportions. Economic instruments should be used in coordination to gradually form a new economic operation mechanism of “the state regulates the market, and the market guides enterprises.”

Reform of the investment system should focus on establishing and improving the fixed asset investment fund system, comprehensively implementing bidding for project design and construction, thereby improving project quality, saving investment, shortening construction periods, optimizing investment structure, and enhancing investment efficiency, while reasonably controlling the scale of fixed asset investment. In the future, construction funds must be raised through multiple channels and used on a compensated basis. The state should gradually concentrate investment in infrastructure and basic industries that concern the whole economy, while shifting the主体 of operating investment gradually toward enterprises in conjunction with fiscal and financial reforms.

Fiscal reform should, on the basis of enterprises implementing contract responsibility systems, gradually shift toward tax–profit separation and rationalize the distribution relationship between the state and enterprises. On the basis of unified leadership, hierarchical management, and division of responsibilities, fiscal revenues and expenditures at each level should be adjusted, implementing various forms of fiscal contracting systems. The tax system should be gradually improved, tax categories and rates adjusted appropriately, and conditions actively created to move toward a tax-sharing system and repayment-after-tax system. Tax collection and administration should be strengthened so that taxation can fully play its role in economic regulation. A state asset management system should be established without delay.

In the reform of the financial system, the central bank’s regulatory system must be further improved so that it can play its important role in macroeconomic regulation. Monetary issuance should be controlled to avoid inflation while ensuring a reasonable money supply to maintain stable economic growth. Future fiscal deficits will mainly be financed through the issuance of government bonds. By corporatizing specialized banks and opening financial markets, social funds can be actively mobilized, with loans extended selectively to facilitate industrial restructuring, support key construction projects, production in industry and agriculture, and export earnings.

Price reform should continue along the path of combining liberalization, adjustment, and regulation, gradually rationalizing the price system and management regime to promote the development of the commodity economy. The irrational relative prices of a few essential goods must be adjusted step by step, while general commodity prices continue to be liberalized, with strengthened market guidance and supervision. For key raw materials and energy, the portion under mandatory planning will remain subject to state pricing, while the rest will be priced through negotiations between regions or enterprises. For negotiated prices, floating ranges or ceiling prices may be set for guidance when necessary. Industry-wide price collusion must be firmly prevented, and arbitrary or disguised price increases must be strictly prohibited.

Commercial system reform should be accelerated, with active development of wholesale markets and exploration of futures trading. While giving play to the regulatory role of the market, market supervision must be strengthened. Reform of rural supply and marketing cooperatives should be advanced to promote the development of the rural commodity economy. Reform of the material supply system should be accelerated, reducing the varieties and quantities of materials under mandatory allocation, strengthening management of key materials, gradually establishing and developing various forms of production material markets, and invigorating material circulation.

Labor and wage system reform must be deepened. The labor contract system should continue to be implemented, giving enterprises real authority in recruitment and employment, thus optimizing labor composition. The labor and technology markets should be developed to promote rational mobility of talent. Gradually, total enterprise wage bills should be managed hierarchically by region and sector. Enterprises with suitable conditions may implement systems linking total wages with economic performance. Internal wage forms and assessment methods should be determined independently by enterprises, while the state uses taxation to regulate the pace of wage growth, gradually separating enterprise wage systems from those of Party and government organs and public institutions. Enterprises should universally establish risk fund systems.

Reform of the housing system in towns and cities, especially in large and medium-sized cities, should be accelerated, gradually implementing housing commercialization. This will help adjust the consumption structure of urban residents, change consumption concepts, and correct malpractice in housing allocation, thereby benefiting both the state and the people. Governments at all levels should, under unified national policy, study and formulate plans according to local conditions, advancing reform step by step. In conjunction with housing reform, the real estate market should be developed and compensated transfer of land-use rights implemented.

Reform of the social security system should also be accelerated. Various social insurance systems should be established and improved, welfare undertakings further developed, and preferential treatment and relief efforts continued, gradually forming a social security system with Chinese characteristics.

It must be emphasized that while carrying out reforms in various management systems, economic legislation and judicial work must be strengthened. Taxation, industrial and commercial administration, auditing, and supervisory systems must be improved, and economic management and supervision enhanced, in order to safeguard social order and ensure the healthy development of the national economy.
