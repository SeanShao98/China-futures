**CPC Central Committee and State Council Opinions on Further Strengthening Rural Work and Raising Comprehensive Agricultural Production Capacity**  
(December 31, 2004)

The Party Central Committee and the State Council have always attached great importance to work concerning agriculture, rural areas, and farmers. In 2004, macro-control placed emphasis on strengthening agriculture, and a series of more direct and forceful policy measures were implemented. All regions and departments conscientiously carried out the central authorities’ decisions, protecting and mobilizing farmers’ enthusiasm and bringing about a sound development landscape in the countryside. Grain production registered an important turnaround; farmers’ incomes grew rapidly; rural reform made major strides; and rural social programs achieved fresh progress. This played a crucial role in promoting national economic development and maintaining social stability. At the same time, we must soberly recognize that agriculture remains the weak link in the national economy. Insufficient input and a fragile foundation have not changed; long-term mechanisms for boosting grain output and farmers’ incomes have not been established; deep-seated contradictions restraining agricultural and rural development have not been eliminated; and the pronounced lag in rural economic and social development has not been fundamentally reversed. Rural reform and development are still in a difficult uphill and tackle-the-tough-issues stage, and the task of maintaining the good momentum in rural development is extremely arduous.

The overall requirements for agricultural and rural work in 2005 are: earnestly implement the spirit of the 16th National Congress of the CPC and the Third and Fourth Plenary Sessions of the 16th CPC Central Committee; fully put into practice the Scientific Outlook on Development; follow the strategy of coordinating urban–rural development; adhere to the principle of “giving more, taking less, and letting go”; stabilize, improve, and strengthen all policies supporting agriculture; effectively enhance the building of comprehensive agricultural production capacity; continue to adjust the structure of agriculture and the rural economy; further deepen rural reform; strive to achieve steady growth in grain production and sustained increases in farmers’ incomes; and promote comprehensive economic and social development in rural areas.

Strengthening the agricultural foundation and revitalizing the rural economy require continued comprehensive measures. Now and for some time to come, we must treat as a major and urgent strategic task the strengthening of agricultural infrastructure, the acceleration of agricultural scientific and technological progress, and the improvement of comprehensive agricultural production capacity, and we must grasp these firmly. This is both the material foundation for ensuring national food security and a necessary condition for increasing farmers’ incomes; both an urgent need to address prominent contradictions in agricultural development and a strategic choice to enhance agriculture’s future momentum; both a major measure to advance the rural economy and an important guarantee for progress in rural society. Grasping this focus means grasping the key to agricultural development; getting this link right means getting to the root of agricultural modernization; doing this work well lays a solid foundation for building a moderately prosperous society in all respects in rural areas. We must further arouse farmers’ enthusiasm for farming and grain cultivation and local governments’ enthusiasm for prioritizing agriculture and grain, basing ourselves on strict farmland protection, focusing on strengthening farmland water conservancy, supporting progress in science and technology, and guaranteeing with sound service systems. After several years of effort, we should see significant improvements in the material and technological conditions of agriculture, marked increases in land yield and labor productivity, and notable enhancements in comprehensive agricultural efficiency and competitiveness.

## I. Stabilize, improve, and strengthen policies that support agricultural development, and further mobilize farmers’ enthusiasm

1) **Continue to step up implementation of the “two reductions and exemptions, three subsidies.”** Reducing and exempting the agricultural tax, abolishing the agricultural specialty tax (except on tobacco), granting direct subsidies to grain growers, and providing improved-seed and agricultural machinery purchase subsidies in some regions are major measures adopted by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council to strengthen agriculture and grain production. They are of great significance in motivating farmers to grow grain and in protecting and enhancing grain production capacity. These effective policies must not be altered; benefits to farmers must not be reduced; and support for agriculture must be continuously increased. Expand the scope of agricultural-tax exemptions and raise the intensity of tax reductions. In 2005, pilot abolition of the agricultural tax will be implemented in key national poverty-alleviation counties, and agricultural tax rates will be further lowered elsewhere. Pilot abolition of the animal husbandry tax will be carried out in pastoral areas. State-owned farm enterprises shall implement the same agricultural-tax reduction and exemption policies as where they are located. Local fiscal revenue reduced by agricultural (and animal husbandry) tax relief shall be partially compensated by special transfer payments from the central government. Where conditions permit, localities may independently pilot agricultural-tax exemptions. Continue providing direct subsidies to grain growers, with conditions-permitting localities further increasing subsidy intensity. The central government will continue to raise funding for improved-seed subsidies and agricultural machinery purchase subsidies; local governments shall also allocate appropriate funds based on local finances and agricultural needs. Continue implementing minimum purchase prices for key short-supplied grain varieties in major producing areas, and gradually establish and improve systems and mechanisms to stabilize grain market prices and protect grain farmers’ interests. Ensure supply and regulate markets for agricultural production materials; continue ex-factory price caps for chemical fertilizers; use tax measures to reasonably adjust fertilizer imports and exports and curb excessive price rises; and crack down hard on counterfeit and substandard inputs and all forms of predatory practices harming farmers.

2) **Effectively strengthen support for major grain-producing areas.** To motivate local governments to develop grain production and to ease fiscal difficulties in central and western regions—especially counties and townships in major grain-producing areas—the central treasury shall, based on sown area, output, and commercial grain volume, provide rewards and subsidies to major grain-producing counties through transfer payments. Establish an interest coordination mechanism between major grain-producing and major grain-consuming areas; adjust the central subsidy ratio for the grain risk fund; and raise funds through other economic means to support production-capacity building in major grain-producing areas. Relevant departments shall promptly study and propose concrete implementation plans.

3) **Establish stable, growing channels for funds supporting agriculture.** With determination, adjust the national income distribution structure. On the basis of stabilizing existing agricultural inputs, new fiscal expenditures and fixed-asset investment must tilt toward agriculture, rural areas, and farmers, gradually forming a stable growth mechanism for agricultural inputs. In view of weak farmland water conservancy urgently needing reinforcement, from 2005 onward, in addition to continuing construction of large and medium-sized farmland water conservancy infrastructure, inputs into small-scale farmland water conservancy shall be steadily increased. On the basis of integrating relevant special funds, the central and provincial treasuries shall allocate a portion of newly increased budgetary revenue to set up special subsidy funds for small-scale farmland water conservancy, supporting households’ labor contributions to build such works. Budgetary regular capital construction investment and treasury-bond funds shall increase allocations to small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. The portion of land transfer fees used for agricultural land development and revenue from paid use of newly added construction land shall, together with land development and consolidation, allocate certain funds for small-scale water conservancy. Municipal and county governments must also increase investment. Legislation should be advanced expeditiously to institutionalize and standardize major agricultural support policies.

## II. Firmly implement the strictest arable-land protection system and truly improve land quality

4) **Strictly protect arable land.** Control non-agricultural land occupation; ensure that the total area, quality, and designated use of basic farmland do not diminish, and implement this down to specific plots and households. It is strictly forbidden to dig ponds for fish farming, plant trees, or conduct other activities that damage the tillage layer on basic farmland. Revise the Interim Regulations on Farmland Occupation Tax and raise tax rates, strictly controlling reductions and exemptions. Improve township land-use master planning and village/town planning to guide intensive rural land use. Strengthen management of collective construction land and rural homesteads; encourage land consolidation and village renovation; promote new rural industries to cluster in townships; and raise overall land-use efficiency. Accelerate reform of rural land expropriation and requisition systems.

5) **Conscientiously implement rural land-contracting policies.** In response to practices in some places of arbitrarily reclaiming farmers’ contracted land and forcing land transfer, all localities shall comprehensively review implementation of the second-round land contracts; resolutely correct violations of law and policy and hold those responsible to account. Properly handle land-contract disputes and resolve conflicts in a timely manner to safeguard farmers’ lawful rights and interests. Respect and protect farmers’ rights to contracted land and to engage in agricultural production, including migrant workers’ land-contract rights and operational autonomy. Transfers of contracted-operation rights and appropriately scaled operations must be conducted lawfully on a voluntary and compensated basis, avoiding one-sided pursuits of land concentration. Provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities shall promptly formulate implementation measures for the Rural Land Contracting Law.

6) **Work hard to build soil fertility.** The central and provincial treasuries shall substantially increase inputs for comprehensive agricultural development, with new funds concentrated in major grain-producing areas for transforming medium- and low-yield fields and building high-standard basic farmland. Implement the “Fertile Soil Project,” expand inputs, strengthen soil-fertility surveys and monitoring, and establish a nationwide dynamic monitoring and early-warning system for arable-land quality to guide scientific cultivation. Reform traditional tillage methods and develop conservation agriculture. Promote soil-testing–based formula fertilization, comprehensive utilization and harmless treatment of organic fertilizers, encourage greater application of farmyard manure, and raise soil organic matter.

## III. Strengthen farmland water conservancy and ecological development to boost resilience against natural disasters

7) **Accelerate continued construction and upgrading of large irrigation districts with a focus on water-saving retrofits.** New fixed-asset investment shall prioritize these upgrades with steadily rising inputs, focusing on on-farm works, replacing aging electromechanical equipment, and improving irrigation and drainage systems. Pilot construction of terminal canal systems in districts under continued construction. Continue advancing water-saving irrigation demonstrations and pilot scaled construction in major grain-producing areas. Where conditions permit, accelerate rural water-conservancy modernization. Areas with favorable water sources should expand irrigated area alongside key water-hub projects; arid areas should develop water-saving dryland agriculture and continue building demonstration zones. Strengthen measurement of irrigation water and actively implement total-use controls and quota management. From 2005 onward, pilot subsidies for farmers purchasing water-saving equipment in selected regions. Continue reinforcement of dangerous reservoirs and advance local medium-scale water sources and treatment of small and medium rivers.

8) **Vigorously promote small-scale farmland water-conservancy construction.** Prioritize on-farm irrigation and drainage, small irrigation districts, and drought-resistant water sources in non-irrigated areas. Step up treatment of salinization and waterlogging in medium- and low-yield fields in major producing areas. Accelerate rainwater harvesting and utilization in hilly/mountainous and other arid regions. Local governments must assume responsibility for this work. While resolutely abolishing labor-accumulation and compulsory-labor systems on schedule, explore new mechanisms and methods for farmland capital works under new conditions. Clearly distinguish between increasing farmers’ burdens and farmers’ voluntary labor to improve their own production and living conditions. On the basis of strengthened democratic decision-making and management, and under principles of voluntariness, mutual benefit, practical results, controlled standards, and strict norms, guide farmers to contribute labor to small-scale facilities from which they directly benefit. The state shall provide appropriate subsidies for materials needed for micro water-works built by farmers; relevant departments shall promptly formulate specific measures.

9) **Unswervingly advance key ecological projects.** Continue natural-forest protection and improve supporting policies. Return-to-forest work must be scientifically planned, focused, pragmatic, and steadily advanced. Take effective measures to build basic staple-grain fields in areas of return-to-forest, cultivate follow-on industries, and genuinely solve farmers’ long-term livelihoods, consolidating achievements. Strengthen shelterbelts and farmland shelter-networks to create ecological barriers for high-standard farmland. Earnestly advance desertification control, including the Beijing–Tianjin sandstorm source control project. Continue comprehensive development in mountainous areas. Further strengthen grassland development and protection, accelerate “return grazing to grassland,” build pastoral water-works, and enhance forest and grassland fire control and pest control. Carry out soil and water conservation in key basins such as the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers; promote small-watershed governance using check dams and other measures; and strengthen comprehensive treatment in southern red-soil hills, northeastern black-soil rolling areas, and karst rocky desertification zones in the southwest. Effectively prevent and control agricultural and water pollution.

## IV. Accelerate agricultural S&T innovation and raise technological content

10) **Strengthen innovation capacity.** Substantially increase inputs in agricultural research; accelerate establishment of a diversified funding system led by government with broad social participation and a stable growth mechanism. Raise the share of national S&T spending going to agriculture, and significantly increase agricultural research funding within major S&T projects and programs. Deepen reform of the agricultural research system and quickly establish a national agricultural S&T innovation system. Strengthen state bases’ innovation capacity; carry out basic and key-technology research; and accelerate research on high technologies such as biotechnology and IT. Based on national agro-ecological zoning and resource integration, build regional agricultural research centers relying on strong provincial institutes and universities to drive regional innovation and conduct major applied R&D and trials. Strengthen national laboratories, breeding centers, engineering centers, and key laboratories in agriculture; improve facilities and equipment; and speed the building of high-level talent training bases.

11) **Increase dissemination of improved varieties and practices.** Continue the “Seed Project” and the “Livestock and Aquatic Breeding Project,” and build and expand bases for major crop and livestock breeding and extension. From 2005, launch a super-rice extension project. Expand special subsidies for major agricultural technology extension, prioritizing development of integrated, high-yield, quality-improving, and cost-saving technologies. Strengthen control of major crop pests and diseases. Organize the “Science and Technology to Households” program, support demonstration households, and raise their spillover impact. Continue allocating funds for S&T result transformation and for introducing advanced foreign agricultural technologies.

12) **Accelerate reform of the agricultural technology-extension system.** In line with strengthening public-service functions and invigorating commercial services, intensify reform. Public agricultural extension institutions shall mainly undertake introduction, trial, and demonstration of key technologies; monitoring, forecasting, prevention, and response for crop pests, animal diseases, and agricultural disasters; compulsory inspections and monitoring of quality and safety in production; monitoring of agricultural resources, ecology, and input use; water-resource management and flood/drought response; and public information and training services. Fiscal authorities at all levels shall guarantee funding for public extension. Meanwhile, general extension and commercial services shall be steadily separated and operated on market principles. Give full play to agricultural colleges in extension; foster farmers’ technical associations and agri-tech enterprises. Explore new mechanisms, employ bidding for extension projects, and encourage various organizations and firms to compete fairly. On the basis of pilots, relevant departments shall promptly issue guidance on strengthening extension-system development.

## V. Strengthen rural infrastructure and improve the environment for agricultural development

13) **Increase investment in small rural infrastructure.** Continue expanding the “six small projects” (drinking water for people and livestock, rural roads, rural biogas, small hydropower, grassland fencing, etc.), broaden coverage, and raise quality. On the basis of consolidating achievements in solving drinking-water difficulties, attach great importance to rural drinking-water safety, addressing issues in high-fluoride, high-arsenic, brackish/saline-water, and schistosomiasis areas; relevant departments shall promptly formulate plans. Adjust highway investment structure to boost rural roads, and coordinate standards, quality, and maintenance with reasonable subsidy benchmarks. Accelerate rural energy development—continue rural biogas, and actively develop solar, wind, and other clean and renewable energies. Expand “small hydropower as fuel substitute,” and strengthen follow-up construction and operation of rural grid upgrades. Increase poverty-alleviation inputs for rural infrastructure in poor areas; guide farmers to build water works, improve soils, and construct roads; implement village-wide poverty-reduction plans; improve mechanisms; and speed up poverty exit.

14) **Accelerate construction of agricultural distribution and inspection/testing facilities.** While continuing to improve fairs and wholesale markets, leverage futures markets’ guiding role; encourage modern logistics, chain operations, and e-commerce. Upgrade wholesale markets; develop broker agency, auctions, and online trading to enhance trading functions. Speed construction of cold-chain systems centered on cold storage and refrigerated transport; treat land for such storage as industrial land. Give play to supply-and-marketing cooperatives in distribution and input supply. Encourage the postal system to offer direct rural delivery and distribution services. Strengthen agricultural informatization; meteorology shall better serve agriculture. Provinces shall open green channels for whole-vehicle transport of perishable produce, implement toll reductions or exemptions, and quickly connect inter-provincially. Advance agricultural standardization. Strengthen inspection/testing infrastructure, raise quarantine equipment and testing levels for imports/exports, and enhance defenses against invasive species. Strengthen agricultural product quality and safety, implement certification and accreditation, ban production/sale/use of highly toxic, high-residue pesticides, and accelerate legislation on quality and safety.

15) **Strengthen comprehensive supporting systems for agricultural development.** Build seven systems: improved seeds and breeds; S&T innovation and application; plant and animal protection; agricultural product quality and safety; market information; agricultural resources and ecological protection; and agricultural socialized services and management. Relevant departments shall quickly develop plans, strengthen policy guidance, clarify responsibilities, increase inputs through multiple channels, and accelerate construction.

## VI. Continue advancing adjustment of agricultural and rural economic structures to raise competitiveness

16) **Further promote grain production.** Adhere to the principle of basic self-sufficiency through domestic supply; be guided by market demand; improve variety structure and optimize regional layout; focus on yield; and strive to maintain overall supply–demand balance. Stabilize and increase sown area; reform cropping systems; and raise multiple-cropping indexes. Implement the high-quality grain industry project; build commercial-grain bases; and develop high-quality grain belts. Strengthen services in technology, machinery, information, and marketing; ensure breeding and supply of improved varieties; and promote cost-reducing, efficiency-enhancing production. Improve and implement the provincial governor responsibility system for grain; major consuming and balanced provinces must also do a good job in grain production, ensure necessary reserves, and stabilize markets.

17) **Vigorously develop specialty agriculture.** Leverage regional comparative advantages, build agricultural industry belts, and develop specialty agriculture. Based on resource endowments, select varieties with local characteristics and market prospects as focal points to quickly form competitive industries. Localities and departments shall formulate plans and policies to accelerate development. Build standardized demonstration bases; screen and propagate fine varieties; integrate traditional methods with modern technology; and raise quality and production levels. Strengthen protection of specialty products; advance origin labeling; safeguard producers’ rights. Integrate and cultivate brands and support building well-known products. Enhance international competitiveness, promote exports of advantageous products, and expand agricultural opening-up.

18) **Accelerate development of animal husbandry.** A robust livestock sector is essential to comprehensive agricultural capacity. In pastoral areas, advance fenced, rotational, and resting grazing; develop forage fields; improve breeds; and ease overgrazing pressure. In farming areas, fully utilize crop straw and abundant labor to develop grain-saving livestock models and raise scale and intensification. Use micro-credit and interest subsidies to guide development of livestock clusters where conditions permit. Increase investment to support clusters in building waste and wastewater treatment. From 2005, implement subsidies for dairy breed improvement. Speed establishment of safe, high-quality, and efficient feed systems. Animal disease prevention is fundamental to stable development, public health, and safety; increase inputs, improve systems, and strengthen capacity. Quickly plan the animal disease-prevention system and accelerate building of major disease surveillance and early warning, prevention and control, inspection and quarantine supervision, veterinary drug quality oversight and residue monitoring, technical support, and material-guarantee systems. Accelerate technical upgrades at key veterinary biologics producers. Quickly build disease-control teams; include personnel and operating funds of animal-quarantine supervision agencies in government budgets at all levels.

19) **Prioritize support for agro-processing in major grain-producing areas.** Vigorously support the food-processing industry, especially grain-based processing in major producing areas. These areas should leverage local advantages, take agro-processing as a breakthrough, follow a new-type industrialization path, and promote higher agricultural efficiency, farmer incomes, and regional development. Provide interest subsidies and other measures to support technology introduction/retrofit and storage capacity building. Improve VAT policies for agro-processing and, in line with overall VAT transformation plans, accelerate transformation for food and other agro-processing.

20) **Develop agricultural industrialization.** Continue strengthening support for leading agribusinesses of diverse ownership and operating forms. Encourage various benefit-sharing linkages with bases and farmers. The Agricultural Bank of China and other state-owned commercial banks, in accordance with regulations, shall improve credit services to leaders and ease seasonal purchase-fund strains. The Agricultural Development Bank may lend to leading enterprises focusing on grain, cotton, and oil production, circulation, or processing. Explore effective approaches whereby leaders and cooperatives take on, guarantee, or service farmers’ loans. Support farmer professional cooperatives and appropriately reduce or exempt relevant taxes and fees on them and their processing/distribution entities. Collective economic organizations shall build strength, deliver services, and—together with other cooperatives—serve as bridges between leading firms and farmers. Township enterprises shall accelerate structural adjustment, technological progress, and institutional innovation and actively participate in agricultural industrialization.

## VII. Reform and improve rural investment and financing, and perfect agricultural input mechanisms

21) **Improve the agricultural investment management system.** Further open investment fields in agriculture and rural infrastructure; use interest subsidies, grants, and tax measures to guide state funds and encourage social capital to invest. Gradually lower counterpart funding ratios for agricultural fixed-asset projects in central and western regions, and do not raise counterpart funds by increasing farmers’ burdens. Strengthen integration of state agricultural funds; encourage county-level integration through planning, overall arrangements, clear responsibilities, and project leverage to improve efficiency. For state-invested/subsidized village projects, accelerate implementation of disclosure, tendering, fund tracking, and post-evaluation to ensure sound fund use and project quality.

22) **Speed reform of property-rights systems for small rural infrastructure.** On the basis of experience, clarify property rights and responsibilities to fully mobilize investment and management enthusiasm. For micro projects built or mainly used by households, ownership belongs to individuals, with certificates issued by township governments. For projects with many beneficiaries, establish cooperative management bodies with state-subsidized assets owned by cooperatives. For commercial projects, establish corporate entities for market-based operations or auction to individuals. Local governments should support privately developed rural infrastructure and regulate fees and services. Accelerate reform in the management of small rural water-works. Reforms must respect farmers’ wishes and protect original beneficiaries’ rights.

23) **Advance rural financial reform and innovation.** Tailored to rural financial needs, accelerate building a rural financial system with complete functions, clear division of labor, clarified property rights, and strong supervision. Quickly develop an overall reform plan. Deepen rural credit-cooperative reform to improve governance, strengthen constraints, and bolster support to agriculture—so they remain the mainstay. Formulate policies within counties defining each financial institution’s obligations to support “agriculture, rural areas, and farmers” and specify the proportion of incremental deposits at and below the county level used locally. Guide postal savings funds collected at and below county level to flow back to rural areas. Strengthen policy-based finance, increase medium- and long-term lending to agriculture/rural development, reinforce the Agricultural Development Bank’s role, and expand its scope. The Agricultural Bank shall continue to support agriculture and serve rural areas. Cultivate competitive rural financial markets; promptly set entry and supervision rules for new multi-ownership rural financial institutions and launch pilots under effective risk control. Where conditions permit, explore microcredit organizations initiated by natural persons or enterprises that are close to farmers’ needs. Implement diversified collateral/guarantee policies for farm households and SMEs. Expand pilots of agricultural policy insurance and encourage commercial insurers to offer agricultural insurance.

## VIII. Raise the quality of rural labor and promote comprehensive rural social development

24) **Carry out comprehensive vocational-skills training for farmers.** In keeping with structure adjustment, specialty agriculture, and production needs, conduct practical, effective, and accessible training in agricultural technology. Rural secondary schools should also strengthen instruction in advanced practical technologies. To support industrial upgrading and competitiveness, advance re-employment and job-transfer training, expand the “Sunshine Project” for rural labor transfer, and speed labor mobility. Finance at all levels shall substantially increase training inputs, using subsidies, training vouchers, and reimbursement systems to improve practicality and efficiency. Mobilize broad social participation.

25) **Further develop rural education, health, culture, and other social programs.** Implement the requirement that incremental funding in education, health, culture, and family planning be used mainly in rural areas, with at least 70% below the county level. By 2007, strive to ensure all poor rural students in compulsory education enjoy textbook-fee and miscellaneous-fee waivers and boarding subsidies; national key poverty counties shall accelerate progress. Uphold a rural-focused health policy; steadily advance the new rural cooperative medical system and medical assistance; implement plans for rural health infrastructure; train rural health personnel; and improve services and emergency response. Strengthen prevention and control of HIV/AIDS, schistosomiasis, and other key diseases, and promote comprehensive rural environmental sanitation improvements such as safe water and toilets. Improve rural family planning; implement reward and assistance policies for some rural families; and advance the “Have Fewer Children to Get Rich” pilot. Where conditions permit, explore rural social security systems. Increase major rural cultural projects,完善 public cultural services, and encourage social participation. Consolidate rural publicity and cultural positions and regulate rural cultural markets. Raise the coverage and quality of the “Village-to-Village” radio/TV program, and advance book delivery to the countryside, film screenings, and cultural information-sharing projects.

## IX. Strengthen and improve the Party’s leadership over rural work

26) **Always take resolving agriculture, rural, and farmer issues as the top priority of the whole Party’s work.** This is a major long-term policy during industrialization, urbanization, and modernization. Party members—especially leading cadres at all levels—must deeply recognize the long-term, complex, and arduous nature of “three rural” work. Even amid favorable trends of rising grain and incomes, we must remain clear-headed; there must be no slackening. In line with the stage of industrialization and policy orientation, and in accordance with the requirement that industry feed back to agriculture and cities support the countryside, we must integrate agricultural and rural economic development into overall national planning, more consciously adjust income distribution, more proactively strengthen agriculture’s basic position, and intensify rural reform, agricultural support, and leadership over “three rural” work.

27) **Further strengthen Party building in rural areas.** Conscientiously implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the 16th CPC Central Committee; in keeping with the advanced-education campaign, deepen the “three-level joint creation” activities for rural Party building; enhance creativity, cohesion, and combat effectiveness of grassroots Party organizations; fully play their core leadership role; and further consolidate the Party’s rural governing base. Step up education and training for rural Party cadres; expand distance-education pilots; strengthen service consciousness and integrity; transform work styles; and improve ability to implement policy, act according to law, develop the economy, and maintain stability, establishing a good image. Care for grassroots cadres and help solve their difficulties. Expand grassroots democracy;完善 village affairs openness, government transparency, and democratic management; establish a vibrant villager autonomy mechanism led by village Party organizations; and effectively safeguard peasants’ democratic rights. Advance rural rule of law, strengthen legal education, and improve comprehensive agricultural law enforcement. Do mass work under new conditions, properly handle social contradictions, care for the needy, and foster a harmonious social atmosphere. Strengthen comprehensive rural public-security management, and punish crimes according to law. Advance mass spiritual-civilization activities, and guide farmers to work hard and be self-reliant, speeding the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects.

Further strengthening rural work, raising comprehensive agricultural production capacity, and achieving higher grain output, greater agricultural efficiency, and higher farmer incomes are of great significance and entail arduous tasks. Let us unite more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Hu Jintao as General Secretary, hold high the great banners of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the Important Thought of the “Three Represents,” strengthen confidence, forge ahead, and work hard to fully accomplish all tasks in agriculture and rural work.
