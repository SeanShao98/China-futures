# Leadership Address  
**Pioneering and Innovating, Striving to Build an Agricultural Futures Market System**

Guided by the spirit of the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, we bid farewell to the extraordinary year of 2002 and welcome the promising year of 2003. On this occasion of bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new, on behalf of the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (hereinafter referred to as “ZCE”), we extend our heartfelt gratitude to all member institutions and to all sectors of society who have long cared for and supported the development of ZCE.

In 2002, under the leadership of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, ZCE adhered to the principle of “promoting development through standardization.” We actively enhanced wheat futures trading, intensified the efforts in developing new products and institutional innovation, and achieved remarkable results. The wheat futures market has taken shape; the contract and system design for new products such as cotton, sugar, rapeseed, high-quality strong gluten wheat, and options have been basically completed. Institutional and technological innovations in futures trading have been implemented or are underway, establishing the foundation for the standardized development of the Zhengzhou futures market.

The year 2003 is a crucial year in the history of ZCE’s development. In accordance with the spirit of the Securities and Futures Regulatory Conference, we will seize this historic opportunity to launch futures trading in new products such as high-quality strong gluten wheat, cotton, sugar, and rapeseed. We will strive to transform the Zhengzhou market from a single wheat futures product into a wheat futures market system, and from grain futures products into an agricultural futures market system, thereby laying the initial foundation for a modern agricultural futures market system. We will adopt effective measures to strengthen market promotion, bring into play market functions, and contribute to the sustained, healthy, and rapid growth of the national economy. We will continue to adhere to standardized management, further improve service quality, accelerate innovation, reduce trading costs, enhance market efficiency, and establish the reputation of ZCE as a fair and credible market.

In the new year, guided by the important thought of the “Three Represents,” we will conscientiously implement the spirit of the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, keep pace with the times, pioneer and innovate, comprehensively open up a new phase of standardized development for the Zhengzhou market, and realize the grand objectives of the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange.
