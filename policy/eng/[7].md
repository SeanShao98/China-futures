**CPC Central Committee and State Council**  
**Opinions on Several Policies to Promote Increases in Farmers’ Incomes**  
(December 31, 2003)  

Zhong Fa [2004] No. 1

Guided by the spirit of the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, in 2003 all regions and departments, in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee, intensified efforts to address agriculture, rural areas, and farmers (“the three rural issues”). They withstood the severe shock of the sudden SARS outbreak, overcame the serious impact of frequent natural disasters, and achieved steady adjustment of the agricultural structure, steady development of the rural economy, steady advancement of rural reform, steady increases in farmers’ incomes, and continued stability in rural society.

At the same time, we must soberly recognize that many contradictions and problems remain in current agricultural and rural development, the most prominent being difficulties in increasing farmers’ incomes. For many consecutive years, per capita net income of farmers nationwide has grown slowly; in major grain-producing areas, farmers’ income growth has been below the national average; for many pure-farming households, income has stagnated or even declined; and the urban–rural income gap continues to widen. Persistently low farmer incomes not only affect improvements in farmers’ living standards, but also affect grain production and the supply of agricultural products; they not only constrain rural economic development, but also constrain growth of the entire national economy; they not only concern progress in rural society, but also the realization of the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects; they are not only a major economic issue, but also a major political issue. The whole Party must, from the height of implementing the important thought of the “Three Represents” and realizing, safeguarding, and developing the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the peasantry, further enhance the sense of urgency and initiative in doing a good job of increasing farmers’ incomes.

The current difficulty in increasing farmers’ incomes is a realistic reflection of profound changes in the internal and external environment of agriculture and the countryside, and a concentrated reflection of deep-seated contradictions accumulated over a long time by the dual urban–rural structure. Under the circumstances of tightening constraints in agricultural product markets and increasingly diversified sources of farmers’ income, promoting increases in farmers’ incomes must involve new thinking and comprehensive measures, with major shifts in development strategy, economic systems, policy measures, and working mechanisms.

The overall requirement for doing a good job in increasing farmers’ incomes now and in the coming period is: all levels of Party committees and governments must conscientiously implement the spirit of the 16th Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee, firmly establish a scientific outlook on development, and—according to the requirements of coordinating urban and rural economic and social development—adhere to the policy of “giving more, taking less, and loosening control.” They must adjust the agricultural structure, expand farmers’ employment, accelerate scientific and technological progress, deepen rural reform, increase investment in agriculture, strengthen support and protection for agriculture, strive to achieve faster growth in farmers’ incomes, and reverse as soon as possible the trend of the widening income gap between urban and rural residents.

## I. Concentrate efforts to support grain industry development in major grain-producing areas and promote income growth for grain-farming households

1) **Strengthen grain production capacity in producing areas.** The current problems of low profitability in grain cultivation and difficulties in increasing farmers’ incomes in major grain-producing areas are particularly acute and must be addressed with effective measures as soon as possible. Grasping the income issue of grain farmers is to grasp the focus of raising farmers’ incomes; mobilizing farmers’ enthusiasm for grain cultivation is to grasp the root of grain production; protecting and enhancing grain production capacity in producing areas is to stabilize the national grain situation. Starting in 2004, the state will implement a high-quality grain industry program, selecting a number of counties with a strong foundation and potential and state farms to focus on building national high-quality specialty grain bases. Efforts shall focus on supporting the construction of drought–flood–resilient, stable, high-yield basic farmland in producing areas—especially in the central grain zone. Expand the “Fertile Soil Project,” continuously improving cultivated-land quality. Strengthen breeding of seeds for major grain crops and plant protection projects, enhance technology integration capacity, and give priority support to producing areas for the dissemination of impactful improved varieties and advanced applicable technologies. Centered on basic farmland construction, accelerate small and medium-sized water conservancy projects, expand effective irrigation area, and improve drainage and drought resistance. Raise levels of agricultural mechanization and provide certain subsidies for the purchase and renewal of large agricultural machinery by individual farmers, farm workers, farm machinery specialists, and machinery service organizations directly engaged in agricultural production.

2) **Support grain processing and conversion in producing areas.** Producing areas shall leverage grain advantages to increase farmers’ incomes and develop regional economies, and—according to market demand—build a strong grain industry. Make full use of abundant feed resources to actively develop animal husbandry in farming regions. Through small loans, interest subsidies, and insurance services, support farmers and enterprises to purchase superior breeds and develop breeding, thereby raising grain value through the development of animal husbandry. In line with national industrial policy, guide rational layout of agricultural processing and support producing areas to develop agricultural processing industries that use grain as the main raw material, with emphasis on deep processing. Through interest subsidies for technological transformation loans, equity investment, and tax policies, the state will support producing areas to establish or upgrade a batch of large agricultural processing, seed marketing, and agri-tech enterprises.

3) **Increase investment in major grain-producing areas.** Existing funds for agricultural fixed-asset investment, comprehensive agricultural development, and land reclamation shall be relatively concentrated and tilted toward producing areas. Continue to increase comprehensive agricultural development funds, with the increment mainly used for producing areas. To truly support revitalization of producing areas and promote farmers’ incomes, open new funding channels: starting in 2004, earmark a certain proportion of state-owned land transfer proceeds to support agricultural land development, build high-standard basic farmland, and raise comprehensive grain production capacity. Major sales areas and balanced regions shall also strengthen grain production capacity. Further strengthen ties between producing and consuming areas. Business entities in sales areas establishing production bases, storage, and processing in producing areas shall enjoy the relevant state support policies for producing areas; producers building storage and processing in sales regions to develop markets shall be supported by sales-area governments with necessary preferential policies.

## II. Continue advancing agricultural structural adjustment and tap internal drivers of agricultural income growth

4) **Comprehensively raise agricultural product quality and safety.** In recent years, structural adjustment has made great strides, with correct direction and evident results, and must continue unswervingly. On the premise of protecting and improving comprehensive grain capacity, follow the requirements of high yield, high quality, high efficiency, ecology, and safety; take the path of refinement, intensification, and industrialization; extend both breadth and depth of agricultural development; and continuously create space for higher efficiency and incomes. Accelerate implementation of advantageous agricultural product regional layouts, give full play to comparative advantages, and continue to adjust regional agricultural layout. Construction of markets and processing layouts, technology extension, and quality-safety testing service systems shall all be oriented to forming belts of advantageous industries. In 2004, increase funding and expand seed subsidies in advantageous grain areas such as for wheat and soybeans. Further strengthen agricultural standardization, and carry out demonstration-zone building. Improve inspection, monitoring, and certification systems for quality and safety, implement geographical indications, pilot compulsory certification for agricultural inputs, and expand supply of pollution-free, green, and organic products. Strengthen animal disease prevention systems, implement emergency prevention projects for key regions, encourage establishment of livestock and poultry farming clusters in villages and towns, and in 2004 launch pilot reforms of the veterinary administration. Accelerate separation of statutory inspection from commercial inspection; reduce items for statutory inspection with fiscal subsidies; and control fees and strengthen oversight for commercial inspection.

5) **Accelerate development of agricultural industrialization.** All levels of finance shall set up special funds to support agricultural industrialization, substantially increasing investment in leading enterprises. For qualifying leading enterprises, provide interest subsidies for technology transformation loans. Provide fiscal support for leading enterprises’ farmer training, marketing services, R&D and introduction of new varieties/technologies, base development, and pollution control. Create conditions to improve VAT policies for agricultural processing. Strengthen entrepreneurial support for newly established small and medium agro-processing enterprises. Regardless of ownership form, any leading enterprise that can drive farmers, establish a reasonable benefit-sharing mechanism with them, and bring tangible benefits to farmers shall receive equal support in fiscal, tax, and financial policies.

6) **Strengthen agricultural research and extension.** With a focus on enhancing innovation, reserve, and transformation capacities in agricultural science and technology, reform the agri-science system and substantially increase budgetary investment in agri-research. Continue funding the introduction of advanced foreign agricultural technologies and increase funds for commercialization of research results. Support pilot-scale and large-area demonstrations of existing results. Guide and promote enterprises to become the main body of agri-tech innovation, allowing various agricultural enterprises and private agri-tech organizations to apply for national funds for R&D, introduction, and promotion. Deepen reform of agri-tech extension systems; accelerate formation of an extension system where state agencies and other ownership-based organizations co-develop and complement each other. Give full play to demonstration farms, science parks, leading enterprises, and farmer cooperatives in promotion. Establish cross-regional, specialized new service organizations compatible with industrial belts. Support agricultural colleges and universities to participate in research and extension.

## III. Develop rural secondary and tertiary industries to broaden income channels

7) **Advance reform and adjustment of township and village enterprises (TVEs).** Developing TVEs is an important channel to utilize rural resources and factors, develop the rural economy in all respects, and expand internal rural employment. In line with market demand changes, industrial upgrading, and transformation of growth models, adjust TVE development strategies and modes, accelerate technological progress and institutional innovation, and focus on agro-processing, services, and labor-intensive enterprises. Increase support for technological upgrading of above-scale TVEs to promote product renewal and industrial upgrading. Guide rural collective enterprises to restructure into shareholding or shareholding cooperative enterprises and encourage capable TVEs to establish modern corporate systems. Rural SMEs significantly boost employment; as long as they meet safety and environmental standards and promote rational resource use, they should be allowed to exist and develop. Relevant departments should, based on new situations, promptly formulate guiding opinions to promote TVE reform and development.

8) **Vigorously develop rural individually owned and private economies.** Rural self-employed and private enterprises may enter infrastructure, public utilities, and other sectors not prohibited by laws and regulations. Provide support in taxation, financing, resource use, and talent policies. For lawfully operating small mobile vendors, unless the state otherwise provides, exempt them from business registration and related taxes/fees.

9) **Invigorate small-town economies.** Small-town construction should be combined with strengthening county economies, developing TVEs, advancing agricultural industrialization, and resettlement, guiding more farmers into small towns and gradually forming a virtuous circle of industrial development, population agglomeration, and market expansion to enhance small towns’ capacity to absorb rural population and drive rural development. State fixed-asset investment shall continue to support small-town construction, and financial institutions shall be guided to support their development according to market rules. Construction in key fishing ports, forest areas, and farm headquarters shall be combined with small-town development. Where conditions permit, accelerate village construction and environmental remediation.

## IV. Improve the environment for farmers seeking urban employment and increase migrant-worker income

10) **Safeguard the lawful rights and interests of farmers working in cities.** Further clean up and abolish discriminatory provisions and unreasonable charges against farmers seeking urban employment; simplify procedures for cross-regional employment; and prevent disguised fees on migrant workers and employers. Migrant workers have become an important part of the industrial workforce and create wealth and tax revenue for cities. Urban governments shall include vocational training, children’s education, labor security, and other services and management for migrant workers in normal fiscal budgets—improving existing policies and implementing those not yet in place. There are clear national policies on timely payment of wages, improving work conditions, and children’s schooling; regions and departments shall adopt stronger measures, designate lead agencies, define responsibilities, and strengthen supervision and inspection. Improve laws and regulations to protect migrants’ rights and interests according to law. Advance household registration reform in large and medium cities and relax conditions for farmers to work and settle in cities.

11) **Strengthen vocational skills training for rural labor.** This is a fundamental task for improving farmers’ employability and the nation’s industrial competitiveness and must be earnestly grasped. Based on market and enterprise needs and basic skill requirements by industry/occupation, arrange training content and conduct targeted training. Mobilize all sectors to participate, and encourage training institutions and employers to carry out training. All levels of finance shall allocate dedicated funds for rural vocational training. To improve efficiency and effectiveness, farmers shall independently choose institutions, content, and timing, with the government providing appropriate subsidies. Prevent and correct compulsory paid training and qualification testing.

## V. Give full play to market mechanisms and invigorate circulation of agricultural products

12) **Cultivate marketing entities for agricultural products.** Encourage various farmer cooperatives, large buyers/sellers, and rural brokers. Accelerate legislation on farmer cooperatives. From 2004, central and local governments shall allocate special funds to support cooperatives’ services in information, technology, training, standards and certification, and marketing. Financial institutions shall support cooperatives in building standardized bases, storage, processing, and logistics equipment purchases; finance may provide interest subsidies. Deepen supply-and-marketing cooperative reform and leverage their role in helping farmers enter markets. Accelerate development of chain stores, supermarkets, and distribution for agricultural products; encourage conversion of urban farm markets into supermarkets where feasible; support leading enterprises to operate agri-supermarkets and extend networks into communities. Strengthen wholesale market construction in production and sales areas and create conditions to develop modern logistics. Strengthen the agricultural inputs market, ensure adequate supply and basically stable prices, and severely crack down on counterfeit/substandard inputs that harm farmers. Support circulation of fresh produce and build efficient nationwide “green channels”; improve local circulation environments based on local realities.

13) **Expand exports of advantageous agricultural products.** Improve policies to promote exports. Tilt Foreign Trade Development Fund toward agricultural exports—mainly to support R&D of new products/technologies, market development, and international certification, and to support export bases. Encourage agro-export processors to enter export-processing zones. Launch pest-free area construction for horticultural products. Improve policy-based export credit insurance. Relevant departments shall closely monitor and promptly inform enterprises of domestic and foreign market supply–demand, policies and regulations, epidemics, and inspection/quarantine standards. Strengthen external negotiations and sign bilateral inspection/quarantine and preferential trade agreements with key markets to create a favorable environment. Adapt to new trends in agricultural trade and accelerate establishment of industry and commodity associations for key exported products such as poultry, vegetables, and fruit.

## VI. Strengthen rural infrastructure to create conditions for income growth

14) **Continue increasing fiscal input in agriculture and rural development.** To strengthen agricultural infrastructure and solve the “three rural issues,” further adjust national income distribution and fiscal expenditure structures. Governments at all levels shall, by law, arrange and implement budgetary expenditures on agriculture and rural areas, strictly execute budgets, and establish a stable growth mechanism for fiscal funds supporting agriculture. In line with unified planning, clear division of labor, and overall coordination, integrate existing agricultural investment, concentrate financial resources, highlight priorities, and improve efficiency. Actively use tax, interest subsidies, subsidies, and other economic instruments to encourage and guide social capital into agriculture and rural areas. Governments shall truly prioritize rural social undertakings and implement policies that channel increased education, health, and cultural funding primarily to rural areas, with annual special inspections to follow up.

15) **Further strengthen agricultural and rural infrastructure.** The proportion of state fixed-asset investment for agriculture and rural areas shall be kept stable and gradually increased. Appropriately adjust the investment structure, increasing support for agricultural structural adjustment and small/medium rural infrastructure. The six small projects—water-saving irrigation, safe drinking water for people and livestock, rural roads, rural biogas, small hydropower, and pasture fencing—play positive roles in improving production/living conditions, boosting employment, and increasing income; investment scales shall be expanded, content enriched, and scope widened. Based on local conditions, carry out small facilities such as rainwater harvesting, river–canal rehabilitation, pastoral water conservancy, small watershed management, water/toilet improvements, and straw gasification. Innovate and improve management and operation mechanisms for rural infrastructure. Continue ecological construction; coordinate and localize protection of natural forests, returning farmland to forest/grassland, and wetland protection; consolidate results and emphasize practical effectiveness.

## VII. Deepen rural reform to provide institutional guarantees for increasing incomes and reducing burdens

16) **Accelerate reform of the land expropriation system.** Governments at all levels shall strictly implement the most stringent cultivated land protection system; strictly observe approval authority and procedures for non-agricultural land use; and strictly implement overall land-use plans, upholding principles of safeguarding farmers’ rights and controlling the scale of land acquisition. Strictly distinguish public-welfare land from business land, and clearly define the government’s power and scope of land expropriation. Improve procedures and compensation mechanisms, raise compensation standards, improve distribution methods, properly resettle land-losing farmers, and provide them social security. Actively explore channels for collective non-agricultural construction land to enter the market.

17) **Deepen grain circulation system reform.** Starting in 2004, the state will fully liberalize grain purchase and sale markets and implement multi-channel operations. Relevant departments shall promptly clean up and revise policies and regulations unfavorable to free circulation of grain. Accelerate reform of state-owned grain purchase/sale enterprises, transform operating mechanisms, improve spot and futures grain markets, strictly prohibit regional blockades, strengthen cooperation between producing and consuming areas, optimize reserve layouts, and enhance market management and macro-control. At present, producing areas shall emphasize the main-channel role of state-owned and state-controlled grain purchase/sale enterprises. To protect grain farmers’ interests, establish a system of direct subsidies to farmers. In 2004, the state will allocate part of the grain risk fund to direct subsidies for grain farmers in producing areas. Other regions shall also implement direct subsidies for grain farmers in key producing counties/cities in their jurisdictions. Based on the principle of mobilizing grain cultivation, formulate practical, supervisable implementation methods to ensure that subsidies truly reach farmers.

18) **Continue advancing rural tax–fee reform.** Consolidate and develop the results of tax–fee reform, further reduce farmers’ burdens, and create conditions for ultimately unifying the urban–rural tax system. Gradually reduce the agricultural tax rate; in 2004, reduce the overall agricultural tax rate by 1 percentage point and abolish the agricultural specialty tax (except on tobacco leaves). Revenue reductions after tax cuts shall, in principle, be absorbed by coastal developed regions themselves; for major producing areas and central/western regions, the central government will address this through transfer payments. Where conditions permit, further reduce or exempt agricultural taxes. All regions shall strictly adjust down to the household level according to the reduction ratio so that farmers genuinely benefit; ensure transfer payments are earmarked, timely, and in full. Reduce taxable acreage in line with the actual reduction of cultivated land due to lawful land acquisition. Accelerate supporting reforms, continue strengthening supervision of farmers’ burdens, and prevent rebound to consolidate reform results. Further streamline township institutions and payrolls, steadily adjust township administrative setups, and—where conditions permit—merge villages and encourage cadre cross-posting. Optimize rural school layouts and teacher staffing. Further clean up and standardize administrative fees related to agriculture. Consolidate outcomes in rectifying abuse of authority to publish/distribute periodicals. Explore effective ways to address village-level debts. Formulate collection and administration measures for the agricultural tax as soon as possible.

19) **Reform and innovate the rural financial system.** Based on rural realities and farmers’ needs—and following the requirements of facilitating loans to households and enterprises and improving services—accelerate reform and innovation. Establish mechanisms for financial institutions to serve rural communities and clarify obligations to serve the “three rurals.” Expand interest-rate floating ranges on rural loans. Improve postal savings policies, intensify rural credit cooperative reform, and alleviate capital outflows. The Agricultural Bank and other commercial banks shall innovate products and service methods to broaden lending channels for agriculture. The Agricultural Development Bank and other policy banks shall adjust functions, divide responsibilities rationally, and expand services to agriculture and rural areas. Summarize rural credit cooperative reform pilots and create conditions for gradual nationwide rollout. Continue expanding farmer microcredit and mutual-guarantee loans. Encourage qualified areas—under strict supervision and effective risk control—to attract social and foreign capital to establish multi-ownership financial organizations directly serving the “three rurals.” Relevant departments shall, based on the realities of households and rural SMEs, propose various guarantee methods and explore pledges of movable property, warehouse receipts, and rights interests. Encourage government-funded credit guarantee institutions to expand guarantee business suited to rural characteristics; where conditions permit, establish agricultural guarantee institutions and encourage existing commercial guarantee institutions to carry out rural business. Accelerate the establishment of policy-based agricultural insurance, select products and regions for pilot first, and—where conditions permit—provide premium subsidies for farmers participating in crop and livestock insurance.

## VIII. Continue poverty alleviation and address production/livelihood difficulties of the rural poor and disaster-affected

20) **Improve the poverty-alleviation mechanism.** Party committees and governments at all levels shall intensify efforts, strengthen accountability, and raise effectiveness. In 2004, the state will continue to increase funding. Based on careful review and accurate baselines, adopt more targeted measures for those still lacking adequate food and clothing, ensuring assistance reaches villages and households. For the extremely poor who have lost working ability, implement social relief and appropriately raise standards. For poor people in areas lacking basic survival conditions, steadily carry out ecological migration and relocation-based poverty alleviation. For low-income poor, focus on improving production and living conditions, developing specialty industries, opening income channels, and reducing and preventing return to poverty. Improve input mechanisms, strengthen fund management, enhance efficiency, adopt disclosure and reporting systems for all poverty funds, tighten supervision and auditing, ensure timely and full disbursement, and truly benefit poor households.

21) **Properly arrange production and livelihood in disaster areas and for difficult households.** In 2003, many places suffered severe natural disasters, and some farmers faced serious difficulties. Party committees and governments at all levels must assume responsibility, organize cadres to go deep into disaster and poor areas to verify situations, promptly distribute relief funds and materials to households, reduce or exempt relevant taxes/fees as prescribed, and organize/guide self-help in production. Where conditions permit, explore establishing a minimum living guarantee system for farmers. Implement policies enabling state farm enterprises to participate in the basic pension insurance for enterprise employees.

## IX. Strengthen Party leadership over efforts to raise farmers’ incomes and ensure policy implementation

22) **Make solving the “three rurals” the top priority of Party work.** All Party members—especially leading cadres at all levels—must always attach importance to the fundamental status of agriculture; always strictly protect cultivated land and protect/raise comprehensive grain capacity; always safeguard the interests of major grain-producing areas and grain farmers; and always emphasize raising farmers’ incomes, especially those of grain farmers. Responsibility must be taken not only by the leaders in charge, but also personally by top Party and government leaders; prefectural and county leaders must devote major effort to agriculture and rural work. Establish a scientific outlook on development and a correct view of political achievements; place increasing farmers’ incomes in a more prominent position as a matter bearing on the overall situation. Earnestly transform work style; go to the grassroots and among the masses; implement income-raising measures; and offer ideas, methods, and practical services for farmers’ incomes—avoiding boastfulness and formalism—and use increases in farmers’ incomes as an important criterion for evaluating work. Strengthen training for rural grassroots cadres to enhance their sense of purpose, awareness of law and policy, feelings for the masses, and capacity to lead farmers to prosperity. All sectors must embrace the overall perspective and contribute to farmers’ incomes, forming a favorable social atmosphere. Inspire farmers’ entrepreneurial spirit and perseverance to achieve prosperity through hard work. At the same time—and according to central deployments—strengthen rural grassroots organizations, spiritual civilization, and democracy and the rule of law; do other rural work well; and provide strong organizational guarantees, intellectual support, and a stable social environment for income growth.

Doing a good job in the new stage of agricultural and rural work and striving to raise farmers’ incomes is profoundly significant and arduous. Let us unite more closely around the Party Central Committee with Comrade Hu Jintao as General Secretary, hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, earnestly practice the important thought of the “Three Represents,” strengthen confidence, forge ahead, and work solidly to make new contributions to the comprehensive building of a moderately prosperous society.
