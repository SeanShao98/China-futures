**Article 6**  
The Exchange shall approve hedging quotas based on the applicant’s spot market trading activities, creditworthiness, and market conditions. The approved hedging quota shall not exceed the quantity applied for as supported by the hedging proof materials provided.

The Exchange has the right to require applicants with approved hedging quotas to report their spot and futures trading activities.
