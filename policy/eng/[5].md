**Notice of the State Council on Further Rectifying and Standardizing the Futures Market**  
Guo Fa [1998] No. 27  

To the people’s governments of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government; to all ministries and commissions of the State Council; and to all institutions directly under the State Council:  

In line with the arrangements of the State Council, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (hereinafter referred to as CSRC) has strengthened its efforts to rectify and standardize the futures market. After several years of effort, the momentum of blind expansion in China’s futures market has been effectively curbed, market behavior has become more standardized, and regulatory capacity has improved. However, there remain problems that cannot be ignored, most notably: an excessive number of futures exchanges and brokerage institutions with irregular operations; manipulation of the market by certain institutions and individuals for huge profits; continuing illegal offshore futures and foreign-exchange margin trading activities; and weak regulatory capacity and outdated regulatory methods.  

In order to effectively strengthen supervision of the futures market, guard against and resolve market risks, and ensure the smooth progress of pilot work in the futures market, and in accordance with the spirit of the National Financial Work Conference and the unified arrangements of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, notice is hereby given as follows:  

### I. Continue Rectification and Consolidation of Futures Exchanges  

1. In accordance with the principle of “continuing pilots, strengthening supervision, standardizing by law, and preventing risks,” the existing 14 futures exchanges shall be rectified and consolidated, with only three futures exchanges retained in Shanghai, Zhengzhou, and Dalian. The retained exchanges shall be subject to centralized and unified management, modeled on the management structure of securities exchanges, and placed directly under the CSRC. The general managers and deputy general managers of the futures exchanges shall be appointed by the CSRC, while the chairman and vice-chairmen shall be nominated by the CSRC and elected by the board of directors.  

2. Specific adjustment measures:  
   - **Mergers within the same city**: In line with the principles of unified institutions, unified finance, unified trading, unified settlement, and unified rules, after verification of assets and liabilities, the Shanghai Metal Exchange, the Shanghai Commodity Exchange, and the Shanghai Grain and Oil Commodity Exchange shall be merged into the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  
   - **Networking across different regions**: Other than the three retained futures exchanges, the remaining futures exchanges may be reorganized into corporate local trading halls or local quotation halls, connected to the Shanghai, Zhengzhou, and Dalian futures exchanges. Local trading halls or quotation halls shall provide remote trading seats and order services for exchange members, but shall not list futures contracts, conduct trade matching, or engage in settlement. They shall have corporate legal status and independently assume the debts and claims of the original futures exchanges.  
   - For a smooth transition, unretained futures exchanges may also be reorganized in other ways: first, into futures brokerage companies; or second, where conditions permit, into securities institutions.  

### II. Cancel Certain Commodity Futures Contracts and Raise Margin Requirements for Some Commodities  

To give full play to the functions of futures markets in price discovery and hedging, and to further curb excessive speculation, the number of commodity futures contracts shall be reduced from 35 to 12, with 23 contracts canceled. The contracts retained include copper, aluminum, soybeans, wheat, soybean meal, mung beans, natural rubber, plywood, Japonica rice, malting barley, red beans, and peanuts.  

The minimum margin requirements shall be raised for some commodities. For copper, aluminum, and soybeans—which function well for hedging and are less prone to speculation—the minimum margin ratio shall remain at 5 percent. For the other nine commodities, the minimum margin ratio shall be raised to 10 percent. The Shanghai Futures Exchange, Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange, and Dalian Commodity Exchange shall redesign contracts and list them for trading only after approval by the CSRC. In future, the CSRC may adjust listed products and their margin requirements in accordance with market needs.  

### III. Crack Down on Illegal Futures Brokerage and Rectify Futures Brokerage Institutions  

1. The futures-brokerage qualifications of all non-broker members shall be revoked. Without CSRC approval, no institution or individual may engage in futures-brokerage business. Institutions and individuals conducting illegal futures-brokerage activities under any pretext shall be strictly investigated and banned by the Administration for Industry and Commerce together with the CSRC.  

2. The minimum registered capital requirement for futures brokerage companies shall be raised in order to encourage mergers and restructuring and achieve economies of scale. The CSRC shall separately set the minimum capital requirement.  

3. Futures brokerage companies shall not engage in proprietary futures trading. Their agency business shall be further rectified and standardized in all trading processes, with strict risk control.  

4. The annual inspection system shall be improved, non-compliant futures brokerage companies deregistered, and appropriately large, well-operated, and reputable firms supported.  

### IV. Strictly Control Overseas Futures Trading  

The State Council reiterates that no institution or individual may conduct overseas futures trading without approval. Futures brokerage companies shall not engage in overseas futures business. For a small number of import and export enterprises that truly require overseas futures markets for hedging, strict examination shall be conducted jointly by the CSRC, the State Economic and Trade Commission, and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, and submitted to the State Council for approval before issuing overseas futures business licenses. Enterprises without such licenses shall not engage in overseas futures trading under any circumstances. Licensed enterprises shall use overseas futures markets only for hedging and not for speculation. Relevant authorities shall determine their trading varieties and maximum volumes based on their import and export products and actual trade volumes, and the CSRC shall designate their overseas brokers and exchanges.  

Without approval, overseas Chinese-funded institutions shall not engage in overseas futures trading. Violators shall be held accountable. The State Economic and Trade Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, and other departments shall rectify existing overseas futures-trading activities of industrial and foreign-trade enterprises and report results to the State Council, with copies sent to the CSRC.  

The CSRC shall, together with relevant departments, strengthen oversight of illegal overseas futures trading. Violations involving securities institutions and futures brokerages shall be handled by the CSRC with relevant departments; other institutions’ violations shall be dealt with by the Administration for Industry and Commerce with relevant departments. Enterprises and overseas Chinese-funded institutions that violate these provisions shall be strictly punished; enterprise leaders and responsible personnel shall be dismissed or expelled by their superior departments, which shall also hold leading cadres accountable. Cases constituting crimes shall be transferred to judicial authorities.  

### V. Accelerate Legislative Development and Strengthen Futures-Market Supervision  

As the futures market is highly risky and speculative, legislative development must be accelerated to ensure lawful supervision. The Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council and the CSRC shall promptly draft regulations on futures trading and submit them to the State Council for deliberation. The CSRC shall further strengthen supervision of the futures market and standardize and unify trading, settlement, and delivery systems. Financial institutions, public institutions, and Party and government organs are strictly prohibited from participating in futures trading. State-owned enterprises are strictly prohibited from illegal futures trading. Credit funds and fiscal funds are strictly prohibited from flowing into futures markets in any form. Financial institutions must not provide financing or guarantees for futures trading. Without approval, no institution may engage in financial-futures trading. Violations by domestic financial institutions of foreign-exchange trading regulations shall be investigated in accordance with law. Internal management and external supervision of financial institutions engaging in forward foreign exchange, options, swaps, and similar businesses must be strengthened.  

Effective immediately, all futures exchanges shall cease introducing new contracts. Existing listed contracts may trade until their final trading day. As of January 1, 1999, the new range of futures commodities and margin requirements shall take effect. The CSRC shall further strengthen supervision and enforcement. All regions and departments must conscientiously implement this circular, cooperate fully, and actively assist the CSRC in rectifying and standardizing the futures market to maintain market and social stability.
