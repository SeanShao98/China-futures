# Plan for the Construction of the National Agricultural Products Market System during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan Period

The agricultural products market system refers to the organizational system and structural forms of operation, transaction, management, and service in the circulation of agricultural products. It serves as the bridge and link between production and consumption, and is one of the important supporting systems for the development of modern agriculture. During the Eleventh Five-Year Plan period, with further economic and social development and the comprehensive advancement of new rural construction, agricultural product circulation must become more orderly, standardized, safe, and efficient. Therefore, it is necessary to accelerate the development of the agricultural products market system, improve infrastructure, enhance integrated services, strengthen circulation capacity, increase efficiency, and create better conditions for circulation. This will enable the effective realization of agricultural product value and promote the sustained development of agriculture and the rural economy.

## I. Progress in the Construction of the Agricultural Products Market System during the Tenth Five-Year Plan Period

During the Tenth Five-Year Plan period, the construction of the agricultural products market system advanced rapidly, reflected in the following:

**1. Development of the market system.** By the end of the Tenth Five-Year Plan, the number of agricultural wholesale markets nationwide had stabilized at around 4,300, with annual transaction value increasing year by year, reaching 360 billion yuan in 2005. The number of agricultural trade markets slightly decreased to about 25,000, but the pace of transformation accelerated. Roadside and open-air markets were gradually replaced by standardized markets with fixed facilities. Agricultural products in supermarkets became increasingly important, with sales in cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, and Qingdao accounting for more than one-third of local retail sales of agricultural products. The futures market also advanced steadily. During this period, the state approved cotton and sugar for futures trading, bringing the number of agricultural futures varieties to nine, with an annual transaction volume exceeding 6 trillion yuan.

**2. Improved policy environment.** During the Tenth Five-Year Plan period, the state increased support for agricultural market infrastructure. In 2002, six ministries, including the Ministry of Agriculture, jointly issued the *Opinions on Further Strengthening the Construction of Agricultural Product Circulation Infrastructure*. In 2004 and 2005, the Ministry issued the *Guidelines for the Construction and Management of Agricultural Wholesale Markets (Trial)* and the *Opinions on Strengthening the Work of Agricultural Product Circulation*. These provided clear requirements for direction, content, and functions, offering strong guidance for strengthening agricultural market construction nationwide.

**3. Diversified market actors.** By the end of the Tenth Five-Year Plan, the number of agricultural brokers reached about 5 million, becoming an important force in agricultural product distribution. Farmers’ professional cooperatives increased to about 150,000, playing an important role in organizing farmers to enter the market, enhancing competitiveness, and raising incomes. Leading enterprises in agricultural industrialization exceeded 4,300, with an increasingly strong driving role. State-owned commercial organizations continued to dominate grain, cotton, and other major agricultural purchases and in import-export trade.

**4. Strengthened market services.** By the end of the Tenth Five-Year Plan, 28 provinces (regions) had opened “green channels” for agricultural product transportation. A nationwide “five vertical and two horizontal” green channel network was established, promoting circulation and the development of a unified national market. Agricultural informatization advanced significantly: 31 provinces, about 80% of prefectures, and 40% of counties had established local agricultural information networks, and a national “One-Stop” supply-demand information system was launched, strengthening information services. Quality testing expanded, with 225 designated wholesale markets supported by the Ministry to establish testing centers, compared to only 18 at the end of the Ninth Five-Year Plan—an increase of 11.5 times. Pesticide residue detection capacity improved rapidly.

## II. The Situation Facing Agricultural Products Market System Development during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan Period

**1. The major decision of building a new socialist countryside creates new opportunities.** The Fifth Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee proposed the historic task of building a new socialist countryside. The No. 1 Central Document of 2006 (*Opinions on Promoting the Construction of a New Socialist Countryside*) further clarified goals and requirements. With implementation, the external environment for agriculture and rural development will be optimized. Policies of industry supporting agriculture, urban support for rural areas, and coordinated urban-rural development will be implemented. The agricultural market system, as a key support, will receive greater policy support and new development opportunities.

**2. Enhanced agricultural production capacity provides a solid material foundation.** According to the *11th Five-Year Plan for National Agricultural and Rural Economic Development (2006-2010)*, comprehensive agricultural capacity will increase. Grain output will reach 500 million tons; cotton, oilseed, and sugar production will reach 6.8 million, 32 million, and 120 million tons respectively; production of meat, eggs, milk, aquatic products, vegetables, and fruit will also rise substantially. This provides a strong material basis for prosperous markets while placing higher demands on their development.

**3. Further improvement of the market economy system creates a better institutional environment.** The Eleventh Five-Year Plan period will deepen reforms, further improve the socialist market economy, and promote a unified, open, competitive, and orderly agricultural market system. Institutional barriers to free circulation will gradually be removed, green channel policies will be improved, pricing will become more transparent and fair, and information dissemination will become more efficient, providing institutional guarantees for markets to play their regulatory role effectively.

**4. Increased agricultural openness provides broader space.** During this period, China will fully enter the WTO post-transition stage, further opening its agricultural market. More foreign agricultural products will enter domestic circulation, while more competitive Chinese products will seek overseas markets. This provides broader space but also higher requirements.

**5. Implementation of the *Agricultural Product Quality and Safety Law* raises higher standards.** Effective November 1, 2006, this law marked a new stage of law-based administration in quality safety. It stipulates obligations and responsibilities for strengthening quality supervision in circulation. Markets must establish supporting institutions, equipment, personnel, and systems, backed by legal authority.

**6. Persistent contradictions and problems pose challenges.** Despite progress, gaps remain compared to developed countries. Problems include regional imbalance (strong east, weak west; underdeveloped production-area markets), poor facilities, limited service functions, low farmer organization, fragmented market actors, low efficiency, weak resilience to risk, incomplete legal systems, and insufficient informatization. These pose severe challenges and highlight the urgency of improving the market system.

## III. Guiding Principles and Objectives

**1. Guiding principles.** Guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thought of “Three Represents,” and the Scientific Outlook on Development, efforts will focus on increasing agricultural efficiency, accelerating rural development, and raising farmers’ incomes. In line with the Fifth Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee’s requirements, the goal is to meet growing demand for quantity, variety, and quality of agricultural products. This requires accelerating infrastructure upgrades, improving services, expanding business scope, and modernizing both hardware and management. The aim is to transform market constraints into drivers, enhance competitiveness, and promote sustained development.

**2. Basic principles.**  
- *Government guidance and market operation.* As a quasi-public infrastructure, markets require government guidance in planning, investment, and layout, while respecting economic laws, adopting market-oriented operation, enterprise management, and modern corporate systems.  
- *Adaptation to local conditions with classified guidance.* Different types of markets face diverse environments; guidance should be tailored to regional characteristics, consumer demand, development stage, and economic conditions.  
- *Grounded in reality, advancing gradually.* Development must consider economic, social, institutional, and human factors, moving step by step.  
- *Improved facilities and innovative management.* Construction must combine hardware upgrades with management innovation, advanced circulation methods, and sound systems.

**3. Development goals.** By 2010, under government guidance and support, a unified, open, competitive, and orderly agricultural market system will be established, featuring modern logistics, chain distribution, e-commerce, and futures trading. Wholesale markets will serve as the core, with trade markets, retail shops, and supermarkets as the base. This system will reach a modernization level comparable to that of mid-level developed countries. Goals include:  
- *Enhanced basic functions.* Infrastructure and management improved, with stronger roles in aggregation, pricing, and information dissemination.  
- *Stronger market actors.* Larger scale, better capacity, and stronger resilience; credibility and fair competition promoted.  
- *Quality and safety monitoring capacity established.* Quality testing facilities and reporting systems widely implemented.  
- *Modern circulation advanced.* Grading, packaging, order-based trade, auctions, online trading, chain operations, logistics, futures, and e-commerce developed.
