**Circular of the State Council on Resolutely Curbing the Blind Development of Futures Markets**  
Guo Fa [1993] No. 77

To the people’s governments of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government; to all ministries and commissions of the State Council and all institutions directly under it:

Futures markets are an advanced form of market development. They entail substantial risk and speculation and require stringent regulation. In light of the realities at our current stage, apart from pilot exploration in a small number of commodities and localities, strict control must be exercised and blind development must not be allowed. Since 1988, relevant departments of the State Council have carried out pilot programs to introduce certain futures-trading mechanisms at several wholesale markets and exchanges. Recently, however, some localities and departments have rushed to establish futures exchanges or wholesale markets aimed at developing futures trading, and have blindly set up futures brokerage firms; certain law-enforcement bodies have even engaged in futures brokerage activities; some foreign-funded, Sino-foreign joint-venture or de facto joint-venture futures brokerages have intentionally defrauded clients; some domestic and overseas lawbreakers have colluded to commit futures-brokerage fraud; and some entities and individuals, lacking basic understanding of futures markets, have blindly participated in futures trading at home and abroad, fallen victim to deception, and incurred economic losses. Although these problems have arisen only in a few places, they are widespread in scope, have a very adverse impact, pose significant hidden dangers, and have seriously disrupted the normal progress of pilot work in the futures market. In order to resolutely curb the blind development of futures markets and ensure that pilot work proceeds in a sound manner, the following notice is hereby issued:

1. In conducting futures-market pilot work, the principles of “standardized commencement, strengthened legislation, and proceeding only after trials and under strict control” must be upheld. Macro-management must be strengthened, unified guidance and supervision implemented, and no unit may act on its own. The State Council has decided that guidance, planning, coordination, and supervision of pilot work for the futures market shall be the responsibility of the Securities Commission of the State Council (hereinafter referred to as the Securities Commission), with specific work carried out by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (hereinafter referred to as the CSRC). All relevant departments shall, under the unified guidance of the Securities Commission and in close cooperation with the CSRC, jointly do a good job in the pilot work for the futures market. No futures exchange (center) may be established without the approval of the Securities Commission.

2. The approval and registration of any new futures-trading and futures-brokerage institutions shall be suspended across the board. All existing futures-trading institutions shall, in accordance with futures-trading regulations to be promulgated by the State Council, undergo re-examination and approval procedures; after strict examination by the CSRC, they shall be submitted to the State Council for approval and then uniformly re-registered with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC). Those that, upon re-examination, are not approved shall cease all futures trading. Prior to the promulgation of futures-trading regulations, all existing futures-brokerage institutions shall, in accordance with the *Provisional Measures for the Registration and Administration of Futures Brokerage Companies* (Order No. 11 of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce of the People’s Republic of China), undergo examination by the CSRC and be re-registered with the SAIC. As for foreign-funded and Sino-foreign joint-venture futures brokerage companies, in principle they shall not be re-registered prior to the promulgation of relevant regulations on foreign-related futures; relevant parties shall properly handle the aftermath. Any futures-brokerage institution that, upon re-examination, is not re-registered shall cease conducting futures-brokerage business.

3. Illegal futures-brokerage activities shall be banned. For institutions and individuals engaging in illegal futures-brokerage business under any pretext, administrative departments for industry and commerce at all levels shall, together with relevant departments, investigate and deal with them seriously and resolutely ban them.

4. Participation in futures trading by state-owned enterprises and institutions shall be strictly controlled. Law-enforcement departments and the entities subordinate to them must not engage in futures-brokerage activities. It is strictly forbidden to use bank loans for futures trading. Without approval from the People’s Bank of China and the national foreign-exchange administration authorities, no one may engage in financial-futures business or conduct foreign-exchange futures trading. Futures-trading and brokerage institutions must effectively improve their risk-prevention measures. News organizations shall strengthen publicity on risks related to futures to raise public risk awareness.

   The re-examination of futures-brokerage institutions run by the military system shall be organized by the General Office of the Central Military Commission, which shall, in accordance with the spirit of this Circular and in consultation with the CSRC, formulate specific measures.
