**Reform and Innovation: Building a Modern Agricultural Futures Market**

As the lively monkey bids farewell to the old year and the golden rooster heralds the new, we, on behalf of the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (hereinafter referred to as “ZCE”), extend our heartfelt gratitude to all member institutions and to the various sectors of society who have long cared for and supported the development of the Zhengzhou futures market.

In 2004, ZCE adhered to the principles of lawful supervision and standardized operations. Wheat and cotton futures trading operated steadily, while the development of new products, as well as institutional and technological innovations, continuously achieved new progress. The wheat and cotton futures markets have begun to play a positive role in promoting the adjustment of China’s agricultural planting structure and increasing farmers’ incomes.

In 2005, ZCE will, in line with the spirit of the *Opinions of the State Council on Promoting the Reform, Opening, and Stable Development of the Capital Market*, adhere to standardized operations, exercise strict risk control, pioneer and innovate, and achieve steady development. We will expand market development efforts and further invigorate wheat and cotton futures trading. Guided by the goal of serving the national economy, especially the economic development of central and western regions, we will work to build a modern futures market for major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, oilseeds, and sugar. We will prepare for the listing of new products such as white sugar, wheat options, and rapeseed, promoting their early entry into trading. We will accelerate innovation, building an advanced technical platform through institutional and technological reform to improve market efficiency. We will enhance service standards and reduce trading costs for members and investors. We will also strengthen research and development of new products to lay the foundation for building a modern futures market.

We firmly believe that, under the leadership of the China Securities Regulatory Commission and through the joint efforts of our members, ZCE will gradually develop an agricultural futures market centered on grain, cotton, oilseeds, and sugar, becoming the national hub for trading, pricing, and information in wheat, cotton, sugar, and oilseed futures.
